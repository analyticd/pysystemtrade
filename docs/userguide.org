This guide is divided into four parts. The first [[id:1D9EE0EF-3EA3-4EEA-864F-7DFFE3499F46][How do I?]] explains how to do
many common tasks. The second part [[id:2D7D8DA7-6101-42D1-8E5D-7C54A431818C][Guide]] details the relevant parts of the
code, and explains how to modify or create new parts. The third part [[id:C193F690-BA62-43CB-8997-51667EF233E3][Processes]] 
discusses certain processes that cut across multiple parts of the code in more
detail. The final part [[id:3379846A-4514-428E-BBDB-E0DAB9EEB8D5][Reference]] includes lists of methods and parameters.

** How do I.... Experiment with a single trading rule and instrument

Although the project is intended mainly for working with trading systems, it's
possible to do some limited experimentation without building a system. See [[./introduction.org][the
introduction]] for an example.

** How do I....Create a standard futures backtest

This creates the staunch systems trader example defined in chapter 15 of
my book, using the csv data that is provided, and gives you the position
in the Eurodollar market:

** How do I....Change backtest parameters

The backtest looks for its configuration information in the following
places:

1. Elements in the configuration object
2. If not found, in: Project defaults

Configuration objects can be loaded from [[http://pyyaml.org/][yaml]] files, or created with a
dictionary. This suggests that you can modify the systems behaviour in any of
the following ways:

1. Change or create a configuration yaml file, read it in, and create a
   new system
2. Change a configuration object in memory, and create a new system with
   it.
3. Change a configuration object within an existing system (advanced)
4. Change the project defaults (definitely not recommended)

For a list of all possible configuration options, see
[[id:80DED45B-8AD4-4D5F-AFA2-1543E62C31BD][this table]].

If you use options 2 or 3, you can [[#save_config][save the config]] to
a yaml file.

*** Option 1: Change the configuration file

Configurations in this project are stored in [[http://pyyaml.org][yaml]]
files. Don't worry if you're not familiar with yaml; it's just a nice
way of creating nested dicts, lists and other python objects in plain
text. Just be aware that indentations are important, just like in
python, to create nesting.

You can make a new config file by copying this
[[../systems/provided/futures_chapter15/futuresconfig.yaml][one]], and modifying it. Best practice is to save this as
=pysystemtrade/private/this_system_name/config.yaml= (you'll need to
create a couple of directories first).

You should then create a new system which points to the new config file:

#+BEGIN_SRC python :session :results output
from sysdata.configdata import Config
from systems.provided.futures_chapter15.basesystem import futures_system

my_config=Config("private.this_system_name.config.yaml"))
system=futures_system(config=my_config)
#+END_SRC

*** Option 2: Change the configuration object; create a new system

We can also modify a configuration object from a loaded system directly,
and then create a new system with it:

#+BEGIN_SRC python :session :results output
from systems.provided.futures_chapter15.basesystem import futures_system
system=futures_system()
new_config=system.config

new_idm=1.1 ## new IDM

new_config.instrument_div_multiplier=new_idm

## Heres an example of how you'd change a nested parameter
## If the element doesn't yet exist in your config:

system.config.volatility_calculation=dict(days=20)

## If it does exist:
system.config.volatility_calculation['days']=20


system=futures_system(config=new_config)
#+END_SRC

This is useful if you're experimenting interactively 'on the fly'.

*** Option 3: Change the configuration object within an existing system
(not recommended - advanced)

If you opt for (3) you will need to understand about [[#caching][system
caching]] and [[#defaults_how][how defaults are handled]]. To modify the
configuration object in the system directly:

#+BEGIN_SRC python :session :results output
from systems.provided.futures_chapter15.basesystem import futures_system
system=futures_system()

## Anything we do with the system may well be cached and will need to be cleared before it sees the new value...


new_idm=1.1 ## new IDM
system.config.instrument_div_multiplier=new_idm

## If we change anything that is nested, we need to change just one element to avoid clearing the defaults:
# So, do this:
system.config.volatility_calculation['days']=20

# Do NOT do this:
# system.config.volatility_calculation=dict(days=20)


## The config is updated, but to reiterate anything that uses it will need to be cleared from the cache
#+END_SRC

Because we don't create a new system and have to recalculate everything
from scratch, this can be useful for testing isolated changes to the
system *if* you know what you're doing.

*** Option 4: Change the project defaults (definitely not recommended)

I don't recommend changing the defaults, but should you want to more
information is given [[#defaults][here]].

** How do I....Run a backtest on a different set of instruments

Fixed instrument weights: You need to change the instrument weights in
the configuration. Only instruments with weights have positions produced
for them. Estimated instrument weights: You need to change the
instruments section of the configuration.

There are two easy ways to do this - change the config file, or the config
object already in the system (for more on changing config parameters see [[#change_backtest_parameters]['change
backtest parameters']] ). You also need to ensure that you have the data you need
for any new instruments. See [[#create_my_own_data]['use my own data']] below.

*** Change instruments: Change the configuration file

You should make a new config file by copying this [[../systems/provided/futures_chapter15/futuresconfig.yaml][one]]. Best practice is to save
this as =pysystemtrade/private/this_system_name/config.yaml= (you'll need to
create this directory).

For fixed weights, you can then change this section of the config:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
instrument_weights:
    EDOLLAR: 0.117
    US10: 0.117
    EUROSTX: 0.20
    V2X: 0.098
    MXP: 0.233
    CORN: 0.233
instrument_div_multiplier: 1.89
#+END_EXAMPLE

You may also have to change the forecast_weights, if they're instrument
specific:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
forecast_weights:
   EDOLLAR:
     ewmac16_64: 0.21
     ewmac32_128: 0.08
     ewmac64_256: 0.21
     carry: 0.50
#+END_EXAMPLE

*At this stage you'd also need to recalculate the diversification multiplier
(see chapter 11 of my book). See [[#divmult][estimating the forecast diversification
multiplier]].

For estimated instrument weights you'd change this section:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
instruments: ["EDOLLAR", "US10", "EUROSTX", "V2X", "MXP", "CORN"]
#+END_EXAMPLE

(The IDM will be re-estimated automatically)

You may also need to change this section, if you have different rules
for each instrument:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
rule_variations:
     EDOLLAR: ['ewmac16_64','ewmac32_128', 'ewmac64_256', 'carry']
#+END_EXAMPLE

You should then create a new system which points to the new config file:

#+BEGIN_SRC python :session :results output
from sysdata.configdata import Config

my_config=Config("private.this_system_name.config.yaml")

from systems.provided.futures_chapter15.basesystem import futures_system
system=futures_system(config=my_config)
#+END_SRC

*** Change instruments: Change the configuration object

We can also modify the configuration object in the system directly:

For fixed weights:

#+BEGIN_SRC python :session :results output
from systems.provided.futures_chapter15.basesystem import futures_system
system=futures_system()
new_config=system.config

new_weights=dict(SP500=0.5, KR10=0.5) ## create new weights
new_idm=1.1 ## new IDM

new_config.instrument_weights=new_weights
new_config.instrument_div_multiplier=new_idm

system=futures_system(config=new_config)
#+END_SRC

For estimated weights:

#+BEGIN_SRC python :session :results output
from systems.provided.futures_chapter15.estimatedsystem import futures_system
system=futures_system()
new_config=system.config

new_config.instruments=["SP500", "KR10"]

del(new_config.rule_variations) ## means all instruments will use all trading rules

# this stage is optional if we want to give different instruments different sets of rules
new_config.rule_variations=dict(SP500=['ewmac16_64','carry'], KR10=['ewmac32_128', 'ewmac64_256', 'carry']

system=futures_system(config=new_config)
#+END_SRC

** How do I....Create my own trading rule

At some point you should read the relevant guide section [[#TradingRules]['rules']] as there is
much more to this subject than I will explain briefly here.

*** Writing the function

A trading rule consists of:

-  a function
-  some data (specified as positional arguments)
-  some optional control arguments (specified as key word arguments)

So the function must be something like these:

#+BEGIN_SRC python :session :results output
def trading_rule_function(data1):
    ## do something with data1

def trading_rule_function(data1, arg1=default_value):
    ## do something with data1
    ## controlled by value of arg1

def trading_rule_function(data1, data2):
    ## do something with data1 and data2

def trading_rule_function(data1, data2, arg1=default_value, arg2=default_value):
    ## do something with data1
    ## controlled by value of arg1 and arg2
#+END_SRC

... and so on.

Functions must return a Tx1 pandas dataframe.

*** Adding the trading rule to a configuration

We can either modify the YAML file or the configuration object we've already
loaded into memory. See [[change_backtest_parameters]['changing backtest parameters']] for more details. If you
want to use a YAML file you need to first save the function into a .py module,
so it can be referenced by a string (we can also use this method for a config
object in memory).

For example the rule imported like this:

#+BEGIN_SRC python :session :results output
from systems.futures.rules import ewmac
#+END_SRC

Can also be referenced like so: =systems.futures.rules.ewmac=

Also note that the list of data for the rule will also be in the form of string
references to methods in the system object. So for example to get the daily
price we'd use the method =system.rawdata.daily_prices(instrument_code)= (for a
list of all the data methods in a system see [[#table_system_stage_methods][stage methods]] or type
=system.rawdata.methods()= and `system.rawdata.methods()). In the trading rule
specification this would be shown as "rawdata.daily_prices".

If no data is included, then the system will default to passing a single data
item - the price of the instrument. Finally if any or all the =other_arg= keyword
arguments are missing then the function will use its own defaults.

At this stage we can also remove any trading rules that we don't want. We also
ought to modify the forecast scalars (See [[#scalar_estimate]][forecast scale
estimation]], forecast weights and probably the forecast diversification
multiplier ( see [[#divmult][estimating the forecast diversification multiplier]]). If you're
estimating weights and scalars (i.e. in the pre-baked estimated futures system
provided) this will be automatic.

/If you're using fixed values (the default) then if you don't include a
forecast scalar for the rule, it will use a value of 1.0. If you don't
include forecast weights in your config then the system will default to
equal weighting. But if you include forecast weights, but miss out the
new rule, then it won't be used to calculate the combined forecast./

Here's an example for a new variation of the EWMAC rule. This rule uses
two types of data - the price (stitched for futures), and a
precalculated estimate of volatility.

YAML: (example)

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
trading_rules:
  .... existing rules ...
  new_rule:
     function: systems.futures.rules.ewmac
     data:
         - "rawdata.daily_prices"
         - "rawdata.daily_returns_volatility"
     other_args: 
         Lfast: 10
         Lslow: 40
#
#
## Following section is for fixed scalars, weights and div. multiplier:
#
forecast_scalars: 
  ..... existing rules ....
  new_rule=10.6
#
forecast_weights:
  .... existing rules ...
  new_rule=0.10
#
forecast_div_multiplier=1.5
#
#
## Alternatively if you're estimating these quantities use this section:
#
use_forecast_weight_estimates: True
use_forecast_scale_estimates: True
rule_variations:
     EDOLLAR: ['ewmac16_64','ewmac32_128', 'ewmac64_256', 'new_rule']
#
# OR if all variations are the same for all instruments
#
rule_variations: ['ewmac16_64','ewmac32_128', 'ewmac64_256', 'new_rule']
#
#+END_EXAMPLE

Python (example - assuming we already have a config object loaded to modify)

#+BEGIN_SRC python :session :results output
from systems.forecasting import TradingRule

# method 1
new_rule=TradingRule(dict(function="systems.futures.rules.ewmac", data=["rawdata.daily_prices", "rawdata.daily_returns_volatility"], other_args=dict(Lfast=10, Lslow=40)))

# method 2 - good for functions created on the fly
from systems.futures.rules import ewmac
new_rule=TradingRule(dict(function=ewmac, data=["rawdata.daily_prices", "rawdata.daily_returns_volatility"], other_args=dict(Lfast=10, Lslow=40)))

## both methods - modify the configuration
config.trading_rules['new_rule']=new_rule

## If you're using fixed weights and scalars

config.forecast_scalars['new_rule']=7.0
config.forecast_weights=dict(.... , new_rule=0.10)  ## all existing forecast weights will need to be updated
config.forecast_div_multiplier=1.5

## If you're using estimates

config.use_forecast_scale_estimates=True
config.use_forecast_weight_estimates=True
config.rule_variations=['ewmac16_64','ewmac32_128', 'ewmac64_256', 'new_rule']
# or
config.rule_variations=dict(SP500=['ewmac16_64','ewmac32_128', 'ewmac64_256', 'new_rule'], ....)
#+END_SRC

Once we've got the new config, by which ever method, we just use it in our
system, eg:

#+BEGIN_SRC python :session :results output
## put into a new system

from systems.provided.futures_chapter15.basesystem import futures_system
system=futures_system(config=config)
#+END_SRC

** How do I....Use different data or instruments

Currently the only data that is supported is .csv files for futures stitched
prices (eg US10_price.csv), fx (eg AUDUSDfx.csv), and futures specific (eg
AEX_carrydata.csv), data. A set of data is provided in
[[../sysdata/legacycsv][pysystem/sys/data/legacycsv]]. It's my intention to update this and try to keep it
reasonably current with each release.

You can update that data, if you wish. Be careful to save it as a .csv
with the right formatting, or pandas will complain. Check that a file is
correctly formatted like so:

#+BEGIN_SRC python :session :results output
import pandas as pd
test=pd.read_csv("filename.csv")
test
#+END_SRC

You can also add new files for new instruments. Be sure to keep the file
format and header names consistent.

You can create your own directory for .csv files such as
`pysystemtrade/private/system_name/data/'. Here is how you'd use it:

#+BEGIN_SRC python :session :results output
from sysdata.csvdata import csvFuturesData
from systems.provided.futures_chapter15.basesystem import futures_system

data=csvFuturesData("private.system_name.data"))
system=futures_system(data=data)
#+END_SRC

Notice that we use python style "." internal references within a
project, we don't give actual path names.

There is more detail about using .csv files [[#csv][here]].

If you want to get data from a different place (eg a database, yahoo finance,
broker, quandl...) you'll need to [[#create_data][create your own Data object]]. Note that I
intend to add support for sqlite database, HDF5, Interactive brokers and quandl
data in the future.

If you want to use a different set of data values (eg equity EP ratios, interest
rates...) you'll need to [[#create_data][create your own Data object]].

** How do I... Save my work

To remain organised it's good practice to save any work into a directory like
=pysystemtrade/private/this_system_name/= (you'll need to create a couple of
directories first). If you plan to contribute to github, just be careful to
avoid adding 'private' to your commit ( [[https://24ways.org/2013/keeping-parts-of-your-codebase-private-on-github/][you may want to read this]] ).

You can save the contents of a system cache to avoid having to redo calculations
when you come to work on the system again (but you might want to read about
[[#caching][system caching and pickling]] before you reload them).

#+BEGIN_SRC python :session :results output
from systems.provided.futures_chapter15.basesystem import futures_system

system = futures_system(log_level="on")
system.accounts.portfolio().sharpe() ## does a whole bunch of calculations that will be saved in the cache

system.pickle_cache("systems.private.this_system_name.system.pck") ## use any file extension you like

## In a new session
system = futures_system(log_level="on")
system.unpickle_cache("systems.private.this_system_name.system.pck")
system.accounts.portfolio().sharpe() ## this will run much faster and reuse previous calculations
#+END_SRC

You can also save a config object into a yaml file - see [[#save_config][saving configuration]].

The guide section explains in more detail how each part of the system
works:

1. [[id:6E377012-182F-477D-A7C0-1DD78ADEA71D][Data]] objects
2. [[id:16DF1F18-F821-4D56-8046-77D347B400F8][Config]] objects and yaml files

4. [[id:2A0123A9-6E2E-4854-8BFA-84905ED6B449][Stages]] within a system.

Each section is split into parts that get progressively trickier;
varying from using the standard objects that are supplied up to writing
your own.

** Data
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       6E377012-182F-477D-A7C0-1DD78ADEA71D
:END:

A data object is used to feed data into a system. Data objects work with
a particular *kind* of data (normally asset class specific, eg futures)
from a particular *source* (for example .csv files, databases and so
on).

*** Using the standard data objects

Only one kind of specific data object is provided with the system in the
current version - =csvFutures=.

**** Generic data objects

You can get use data objects directly:

/These commands will work with all data objects - the =csvFutures=
version is used as an example./

#+BEGIN_SRC python :session :results output
from sysdata.csvdata import csvFuturesData

data=csvFuturesData()

## getting data out
data.methods() ## list of methods

data.get_raw_price(instrument_code)
data[instrument_code] ## does the same thing as get_raw_price

data.get_instrument_list()
data.keys() ## also gets the instrument list

data.get_value_of_block_price_move(instrument_code)
data.get_instrument_currency(instrument_code)
data.get_fx_for_instrument(instrument_code, base_currency) # get fx rate between instrument currency and base currency
#+END_SRC

Or within a system:

#+BEGIN_SRC python :session :results output
## using with a system
from systems.provided.futures_chapter15.basesystem import futures_system
system=futures_system(data=data)

system.data.get_instrument_currency(instrument_code) # and so on
#+END_SRC

(Note that when specifying a data item within a trading [[#rules][rule]] you should omit the
system eg =data.get_raw_price=)

**** The [[/sysdata/csvdata.py][csvFuturesData]] object

The =csvFuturesData= object works like this:

#+BEGIN_SRC python :session :results silent
from sysdata.csvdata import csvFuturesData

## with the default folder
data=csvFuturesData()
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_SRC python :session :results output
## OR with a particular folder
data=csvFuturesData("private.system_name.data")  ## assuming you've created data in pysystemtrade/private/system_name/data/

#+end_example

The pathname must contain .csv files of the following four types (where code is
the instrument_code):

1. Static data- =instrument_config.csv= headings: Instrument, Pointsize,
   AssetClass, Currency
2. Price data- =code_price.csv= (eg SP500_price.csv) headings:
   DATETIME, PRICE
3. Futures data - =code_carrydata.csv= (eg AEX_carrydata.csv):
   headings: DATETIME, PRICE,CARRY,CARRY_CONTRACT PRICE_CONTRACT
4. Currency data - =ccy1ccy2fx.csv= (eg AUDUSDfx.csv) headings:
   DATETIME, FXRATE
5. Cost data - 'costs_analysis.csv' headings: Instrument, Slippage,
   PerBlock, Percentage, PerTrade. See [[#costs]['costs']] for more
   detail.

DATETIME should be something that =pandas.to_datetime= can parse. Note that the
price in (2) is the continously stitched price (see [[#vol_calc][volatility calculation]] ),
whereas the price in (3) is the price of the contract we're currently trading.

At a minimum we need to have a currency file for each instrument's currency
against the default (defined as "USD"); and for the currency of the account
we're trading in (i.e. for a UK investor you'd need a =GBPUSDfx.csv= file). If
cross rate files are available they will be used; otherwise the USD rates will
be used to work out implied cross rates.

See [[file+emacs:../sysdata/legacycsv][pysystem/sysdata/legacycsv]] for files you can modify.

*** Creating your own data objects

You should be familiar with the python object orientated idiom before
reading this section.

The =[[../sysdata/data][Data()]]= object is the base class for data. From that we inherit data type
specific classes such as the =[[../sysdata/futuresdata][FuturesData]]= object. These in turn are inherited
from for specific data sources, such as =[[../sysdata/csvdata][csvFuturesData]]=.

So the FuturesData object is defined =class FuturesData(Data)=, and
csvFuturesData as =class csvFuturesData(FuturesData)=. It would also be
helpful if this naming scheme was adhered to: sourceTypeData. For
example if we had some single equity data stored in a database we'd do
=class EquitiesData(Data)=, and =class dbEquitiesData(EquitiesData)=.

So, you should consider whether you need a new type of data, a new
source of data or both. You may also wish to extend an existing class.
For example if you wished to add some fundamental data for futures you
might define: =class FundamentalFutures(FuturesData)=. You'd then need
to inherit from that for a specific source.

This might seem a hassle, and it's tempting to skip and just inherit
from =Data()= directly, however once your system is up and running it is
very convenient to have the possibility of multiple data sources and
this process ensures they keep a consistent API for a given data type.

**** The Data() class

Methods that you'll probably want to override:

-  =get_raw_price= Returns Tx1 pandas data frame
-  =get_instrument_list= Returns list of str
-  =get_value_of_block_price_move= Returns float
-  =get_raw_cost_data= Returns a dict cost data
-  =get_instrument_currency= Returns str
-  =_get_fx_data(currency1, currency2)= Returns Tx1 pandas data frame of exchange rates

You should not override =get_fx_for_instrument=, or any of the other
private fx related methods. Once you've created a =_get_fx_data method=,
then the methods in the =Data= base class will interact to give the
correct fx rate when external objects call =get_fx_for_instrument()=;
handling cross rates and working them out as needed.

Neither should you override 'daily_prices'.

Finally data methods should not do any caching. [[#caching][Caching]] is
done within the system class.

**** Creating a new type of data (or extending an existing one)

it extends =Data=:

** Configuration
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       16DF1F18-F821-4D56-8046-77D347B400F8
:END:

Configuration (=config=) objects determine how a system behaves. Configuration
objects are very simple; they have attributes which contain either parameters,
or nested groups of parameters.

*** Creating a configuration object

There are three main ways to create a configuration object:

1. Interactively from a dictionary
2. By pulling in a YAML file
3. From a 'pre-baked' system
4. By joining together multiple configurations in a list

**** 1) Creating a configuration object with a dictionary

#+BEGIN_SRC python :session :results output
from sysdata.configdata import Config

my_config_dict=dict(optionone=1, optiontwo=dict(a=3.0, b="beta", c=["a", "b"]), optionthree=[1.0, 2.0])
my_config=Config(my_config_dict)
#+END_SRC

There are no restrictions on what is nested in the dictionary, but if
you include arbitrary items like the above they won't be very useful!.
The section on [[#Configuration_options][configuration options]]
explains what configuration options would be used by a system.

**** 2) Creating a configuration object from a file

This simple file will reproduce the useless config we get from a
dictionary in the example above.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
optionone: 1
optiontwo:
   a: 3.0
   b: "beta"
   c: 
        - "a"
        - "b"
optionthree:
   - 1.0
   - 2.0
#+END_EXAMPLE

Note that as with python the indentation in a yaml file shows how things are
nested. If you want to learn more about yaml check [[http://pyyaml.org/wiki/PyYAMLDocumentation#YAMLsyntax][this out.]].

#+BEGIN_SRC python :session :results output
from sysdata.configdata import Config
my_config=Config("private.filename.yaml") ## assuming the file is in "pysystemtrade/private/filename.yaml"
#+END_SRC

In theory there are no restrictions on what is nested in the dictionary
(but the top level must be a dict); although it is easier to use str,
float, int, lists and dicts, and the standard project code only requires
those (if you're a PyYAML expert you can do other python objects like
tuples, but it won't be pretty).

You should respect the structure of the config with respect to nesting, as
otherwise [[#defaults_how][the defaults]] won't be properly filled in.

The section on [[#Configuration_options][configuration options]] explains what configuration options are
available.

**** 3) Creating a configuration object from a pre-baked system

#+BEGIN_SRC python :session :results output
from systems.provided.futures_chapter15.basesystem import futures_system
system=futures_system()
new_config=system.config
#+END_SRC

Under the hood this is effectively getting a configuration from a .yaml file -
[[../systems/provided/futures_chapter15/futuresconfig.yaml][this one]].

Configs created in this way will include all [[#defaults_how][the defaults populated]].

**** 4) Creating a configuration object from a list

We can also pass a list into =Config()=, where each item of the list
contains a dict or filename. For example we could do this with the
simple filename example above:

#+BEGIN_SRC python :session :results output
from sysdata.configdata import Config

my_config_dict=dict(optionfour=1, optionfive=dict(one=1, two=2.0))
my_config=Config(["filename.yaml", my_config_dict])
#+END_SRC

Note that if there are overlapping keynames, then those in latter parts
of the list of configs will override earlier versions.

This can be useful if, for example, we wanted to change the instrument
weights 'on the fly' but keep the rest of the configuration unchanged.

*** Project defaults

Many (but not all) configuration parameters have defaults which are used by the
system if the parameters are not in the object. These can be found in the
[[../systems/provided/defaults.yaml][defaults.yaml file]]. The section on [[#Configuration_options][configuration options]] explains what the
defaults are, and where they are used.

I recommend that you do not change these defaults. It's better to use the
settings you want in each system configuration file.

**** Handling defaults when you change certain functions

In certain places you can change the function used to do a particular
calculation, eg volatility estimation (This does /not/ include trading rules - the
way we change the functions for these is quite different). This is
straightforward if you're going to use the same arguments as the original
argument. However if you change the arguments you'll need to change the project
defaults .yaml file. I recommend keeping the original parameters, and adding new
ones with different names, to avoid accidentally breaking the system.

**** How the defaults work

When added to a system the config class fills in parameters that are missing
from the original config object, but are present in the default .yaml file. For
example if forecast_scalar is missing from the config, then the default value
of 1.0 will be used. This works in a similar way for top level config items that
are lists, str, int and float.

This will also happen if you miss anything from a dict within the config (eg if
=config.forecast_div_mult_estimate= is a dict, then any keys present in this dict
in the default .yaml, but not in the config will be added). Finally it will work
for nested dicts, eg if any keys are missing from
=config.instrument_weight_estimate['correlation_estimate']= then they'll filled in
from the default file. If something is a dict, or a nested dict, in the config
but not in the default (or vice versa) then values won't be replaced and bad
things could happen. It's better to keep your config files, and the default
file, with matching structures. Again this is a good argument for adding new
parameters, and retaining the original ones.

This stops at two levels, and only works for dicts and nested dicts.

Note this means that the config before, and after, it goes into a system object
will probably be different; the latter will be populated with defaults.

#+BEGIN_SRC python :session :results output
from sysdata.configdata import Config
my_config=Config() 
print(my_config) ## empty config
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:

: >>> Config with elements:

Now within a system:

#+BEGIN_SRC python :session :results output
from systems.provided.futures_chapter15.basesystem import futures_system

print(system.config) ## full of defaults. 
print(my_config) ## same object

: Config with elements: average_absolute_forecast, base_currency, buffer_method, buffer_size, buffer_trade_to_edge, capital_multiplier, forecast_cap, forecast_correlation_estimate, forecast_cost_estimates, forecast_div_mult_estimate, forecast_div_multiplier, forecast_scalar, forecast_scalar_estimate, forecast_weight_estimate, forecast_weight_ewma_span, instrument_correlation_estimate, instrument_div_mult_estimate, instrument_div_multiplier, instrument_weight_estimate, instrument_weight_ewma_span, notional_trading_capital, percentage_vol_target, use_SR_costs, use_forecast_scale_estimates, use_forecast_weight_estimates, use_instrument_weight_estimates, volatility_calculation

Note this isn't enough for a working trading system as trading rules aren't
populated by the defaults:

#+BEGIN_SRC python :session :results output
system.accounts.portfolio()
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_example
[snip: Traceback (117 lines)]
Exception: A system config needs to include trading_rules, unless rules are passed when object created
#+end_example

*** Viewing configuration parameters

Regardless of whether we create the dictionary using a yaml file or
interactively, we'll end up with a dictionary. The keys in the top level
dictionary will become attributes of the config. We can then use
dictionary keys or list positions to access any nested data. For example
using the simple config above:

#+BEGIN_SRC python :session :results output
my_config.optionone
my_config.optiontwo['a']
my_config.optionthree[0]
#+END_SRC

*** Modifying configuration parameters

It's equally straightforward to modify a config. For example using the
simple config above:

#+BEGIN_SRC python :session :results output
my_config.optionone=1.0
my_config.optiontwo['d']=5.0
my_config.optionthree.append(6.3)
#+END_SRC

You can also add new top level configuration items:

#+BEGIN_SRC python :session :results output
my_config.optionfour=20.0
setattr(my_config, "optionfour", 20.0) ## if you prefer
#+END_SRC

Or remove them:

#+BEGIN_SRC python :session :results output
del(my_config.optionone)
#+END_SRC

With real configs you need to be careful with nested parameters:

#+BEGIN_SRC python :session :results output
config.instrument_div_multiplier=1.1 ## not nested, no problem

## Heres an example of how you'd change a nested parameter
## If the element doesn't yet exist in your config:

config.volatility_calculation=dict(days=20)

## If it does exist do this instead:
config.volatility_calculation['days']=20
#+END_SRC

This is especially true if you're changing the config within a system,
which will already include all the defaults:

#+BEGIN_SRC python :session :results output
system.config.instrument_div_multiplier=1.1 ## not nested, no problem

## If we change anything that is nested, we need to change just one element to avoid clearing the defaults:
# So, do this:
system.config.volatility_calculation['days']=20

# Do NOT do this:
# system.config.volatility_calculation=dict(days=20)
#+END_SRC

*** Using configuration in a system

Once we're happy with our configuration we can use it in a system:

#+BEGIN_SRC python :session :results output
from systems.provided.futures_chapter15.basesystem import futures_system
system=futures_system(config=my_config)
#+END_SRC

Note it's only when a config is included in a system that the defaults
are populated.

*** Including your own configuration options

If you develop your own stages or modify existing ones you might want to
include new configuration options. Here's what your code should do:

#+BEGIN_SRC python :session :results output

## Then assuming your config item is called my_config_item; in the relevant method:

    parameter=system.config.my_config_item

    ## You can also use nested configuration items, e.g., dict keyed by instrument_code (or nested lists)
    parameter=system.config.my_config_dict[instrument_code]

    ## Lists also work. 

    parameter=system.config.my_config_list[1]

    ## (Note: it's possible to do tuples, but the YAML is quite messy. So I don't encourage it.)

#+END_SRC

You would then need to add the following kind of thing to your config
file:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
my_config_item: "ni"
my_config_dict:
   US10: 45.0
   US5: 0.10
my_config_list:
   - "first item"
   - "second item"
#+END_EXAMPLE

Similarly if you wanted to use project defaults for your new parameters you'll
also need to include them in the [[file+emacs:../systems/provided/defaults.yaml][defaults.yaml file]]. Make sure you understand
[[#defaults_how][how the defaults work]].

*** Saving configurations

You can also save a config object into a yaml file:

#+BEGIN_SRC python :session :results output
from systems.provided.futures_chapter15.basesystem import futures_system
import yaml
from syscore.fileutils import get_filename_for_package

system=futures_system()
my_config=system.config

## make some changes to my_config here

filename=get_filename_for_package("private.this_system_name.config.yaml")

# print(filename)
with open(filename, 'w') as outfile:
    outfile.write( yaml.dump(my_config, default_flow_style=True) )
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: 
: >>> >>> >>> >>> ... >>> >>> ... >>> ... ... ... 6479

This is useful if you've been playing with a backtest configuration, and
want to record the changes you've made. Note this will save trading rule
functions as functions; this may not work and it will also be ugly. So
you should use strings to define rule functions (see [[#rules][rules]]
for more information)

A future version of this project will allow you to save the final
optimised weights for instruments and forecasts into fixed weights for
live trading.

*** Modifying the configuration class

It shouldn't be neccessary to modify the configuration class since it's
deliberately lightweight and flexible.

** System
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       750DA3B8-90B8-4D01-BAE0-F97200E545CA
:END:

An instance of a system object consists of a number of *stages*, some *data*, and
normally a *config* object.

*** Pre-baked systems

We can create a system from an existing 'pre-baked system'. These
include a ready made set of data, a list of stages, and a config.

#+BEGIN_SRC python :session :results output
from systems.provided.futures_chapter15.basesystem import futures_system
system=futures_system()
#+END_SRC

We can override what's provided, and include our own data, and / or
configuration, in such a system:

#+BEGIN_SRC python :session :results output
system=futures_system(data=my_data)
system=futures_system(config=my_config)
system=futures_system(data=my_data, config=my_config)
#+END_SRC

Finally we can also create our own [[#rules][trading rules object]], and pass that in. This
is useful for interactive model development. If for example we've just written a
new rule on the fly:

#+BEGIN_SRC python :session :results output
my_rules=dict(rule=a_new_rule) 
system=futures_system(trading_rules=my_rules) ## we probably need a new configuration as well here if we're using fixed forecast weights
#+END_SRC

the fly' by varying the estimation parameters (in the form use_*_estimates). See
[[#switch_persistence][persistence of 'switched' stage objects]] for more information.

*** Using the system object

The system object doesn't do very much in itself, except provide access
to its 'child' stages, and a limited number of methods. The child stages
are all attributes of the parent system.

**** Accessing child stages, data, and config within a system

For example to get the final portfolio level 'notional' position, which
is in the child stage named =portfolio=:

#+BEGIN_SRC python :session :results output
system.portfolio.get_notional_position("EDOLLAR")
#+END_SRC

We can also access the methods in the data object that is part of every
system:

#+BEGIN_SRC python :session :results output
system.data.get_raw_price("EDOLLAR")
#+END_SRC

For a list of all the methods in a system and it's stages see
[[#table_system_stage_methods][stage methods]]. Alternatively:

#+BEGIN_SRC python :session :results output
system ## lists all the stages
system.accounts.methods() ## lists all the methods in a particular stage
system.data.methods() ## also works for data
#+END_SRC

We can also access or change elements of the config object:

#+BEGIN_SRC python :session :results output
system.config.trading_rules
system.config.instrument_div_multiplier=1.2
#+END_SRC

**** System methods

Currently system only has two methods of it's own (apart from those used
for caching, described below):

=system.get_instrument_list()= This will get the list of instruments in
the system, either from the config object if it contains instrument
weights, or from the data object.

=system.log= and =system.set_logging_level()= provides access to the
system's log. See [[#logging][logging]] for more details.

*** System Caching and pickling

Pulling in data and calculating all the various stages in a system can be a time
consuming process. So the code supports caching. When we first ask for some data
by calling a stage method, like
=system.portfolio.get_notional_position("EDOLLAR")=, the system first checks to
see if it has already pre-calculated this figure. If not then it will calculate
the figure from scratch. This in turn may involve calculating preliminary
figures that are needed for this position, unless they've already been
pre-calculated. So for example to get a combined forecast, we'd already need to
have all the individual forecasts from different trading rule variations for a
particular instrument. Once we've calculated a particular data point, which
could take some time, it is stored in the system object cache (along with any
intermediate results we also calculated). The next time we ask for it will be
served up immediately.

Most of the time you shouldn't need to worry about caching. If you're testing
different configurations, or updating or changing your data, you just have to
make sure you recreate the system object from scratch after each change. A new
system object will have an empty cache.

Cache labels

#+BEGIN_SRC python :session :results output
from copy import copy
from systems.provided.futures_chapter15.basesystem import futures_system

system=futures_system()
system.combForecast.get_combined_forecast("EDOLLAR")

## What's in the cache?
system.get_items_for_instrument("EDOLLAR")

## Note cache items are labelled with tuples: (stagename, itemname, flags). Flags are used when we can have more than one kind of data for a particular item, eg accounting data as a percentage or not.

## Let's make a change to the config:
system.config.forecast_div_multiplier=0.1

## This will produce the same result, as we've cached the result
system.combForecast.get_combined_forecast("EDOLLAR")

## but if we make a new system
system=futures_system(config=system.config)

## check the cache is empty:
system.get_items_for_instrument("EDOLLAR")

## ... we get a different result
system.combForecast.get_combined_forecast("EDOLLAR")

#+END_SRC

*** Pickling and unpickling saved cache data

It can take a while to backtest a large system. It's quite useful to be
able to save the contents of the cache and reload it later. I use the
python pickle module to do this.

For boring python related reasons not all elements in the cache will be
saved. The accounting information, and the optimisation functions used
when estimating weights, will be excluded and won't be reloaded.

#+BEGIN_SRC python :session :results output
from systems.provided.futures_chapter15.basesystem import futures_system

system = futures_system(log_level="on")
system.accounts.portfolio().sharpe() ## does a whole bunch of calculations that will be saved in the cache. A bit slow...

system.get_itemnames_for_stage("accounts") ## includes ('accounts', 'portfolio', 'percentageTdelayfillTroundpositionsT')

## To see what won't be saved down in the cache
system.get_no_pickle_items() ## includes ('accounts', 'portfolio', 'percentageTdelayfillTroundpositionsT'); this won't be pickled

## save it down
system.pickle_cache("systems.private.this_system_name.system.pck") ## Using the 'dot' method to identify files in the workspace. use any file extension you like


## Now in a new session
system = futures_system(log_level="on")
system.get_items_with_data() ## check empty cache

system.unpickle_cache("systems.private.this_system_name.system.pck")

system.get_items_with_data() ## Cache is now populated. Any existing data would have been removed.
system.get_itemnames_for_stage("accounts") ## now doesn't include ('accounts', 'portfolio', 'percentageTdelayfillTroundpositionsT')

system.accounts.portfolio().sharpe() ## this will run much faster and reuse previous calculations
#+END_SRC

*** Advanced caching

It's also possible to selectively delete certain cached items, whilst
keeping the rest of the system intact. You shouldn't do this without
understanding [[#stage_wiring][stage wiring]]. You need to have a good
knowledge of the various methods in each stage, to understand the
downstream implications of either deleting or keeping a particular data
value.

There are four attributes of data stored in the cache:

1. Unprotected data that is deleted from the cache on request
2. Protected data that wouldn't normally be deletable
3. Data specific to a particular instrument (can be protected or
   unprotected)
4. Data which applies to the whole system; or at least to multiple
   instruments (can be protected or unprotected)

Protected items and items common across the system wouldn't normally be
deleted since they are usually the slowest things to calculate.

For example here are is how we'd check the cache after getting a
notional position (which generates a huge number of intermediate
results)

#+BEGIN_SRC python :session :results output
system.portfolio.get_notional_position("EDOLLAR")

system.get_items_with_data() ## this list everything.
system.get_itemnames_for_stage("portfolio") ## lists everything in a particular stage
system.get_protected_items() ## lists protected items
system.get_items_for_instrument("EDOLLAR") ## list items with data for an instrument
system.get_items_across_system() ## list items that run across the whole system or multiple instruments

system.get_instrument_codes_for_item(('forecastScaleCap', 'get_capped_forecast')) ## lists all instruments with a capped forecast
#+END_SRC

Now if we want to selectively clear parts of the cache we could do one
of the following:

#+BEGIN_SRC python :session :results output
system.delete_items_for_instrument(instrument_code) ## deletes everything related to an instrument: NOT protected, or across system items
system.delete_items_across_system() ## deletes everything that runs across the system; NOT protected, or instrument specific items
system.delete_all_items() ## deletes all items relating to an instrument or across the system; NOT protected
system.delete_items_for_stage(stagename) ## deletes all items in a particular stage, NOT protected

## Be careful with these:
system.delete_items_for_instrument(instrument_code, delete_protected=True) ## deletes everything related to an instrument including protected; NOT across system items
system.delete_items_across_system(delete_protected=True) ## deletes everything including protected items that runs across the system; NOT instrument specific items
## If you run these you will empty the cache completely:
system.delete_item(itemname) ## delete everything in the cache for a paticluar item - including protected and across system items
system.delete_all_items(delete_protected=True) ## deletes all items relating to an instrument or across the system - including protected items
system.delete_items_for_stage(stagename, delete_protected=True) ## deletes all items in a particular stage - including protected items
#+END_SRC

**** Advanced Caching when backtesting.

Creating a new system might be very slow. For example estimating the
forecast scalars, and instrument and forecast weights from scratch will
take time, especially if you're bootstrapping. For this reason they're
protected from cache deletion.

A possible workflow might be:

1. Create a basic version of the system, with all the instruments and
   trading rules that you need.
2. Run a backtest. This will optimise the instrument and forecast
   weights, and estimate forecast scalars (to really speed things up
   here you could use a faster method like shrinkage. See the section on
   [[#optimisation][optimisation]] for more information.).
3. Change and modify the system as desired. Make sure you change the
   config object that is embedded within the system. Don't create a new
   system object.
4. After each change, run =system.delete_all_items()= before backtesting
   the system again. Anything that is protected won't be re-estimated,
   speeding up the process.
5. Back to step 3, until you're happy with the results (but beware of
   implicit overfitting!)
6. run =system.delete_all_items(delete_protected=True)= or equivalently
   create a new system object
7. Run a backtest. This will re-estimate everything from scratch for the
   final version of your system.

Another reason to use caching would be if you want to do your initial
exploration with just a subset of the data.

1. Create a basic version of the system, with a subset of the
   instruments and trading rules that you need.
2. .... 6 as before
3. Add the rest of your instruments to your data set.
4. Run a backtest. This will re-estimate everything from scratch for the
   final version of your system, including the expanded instrument
   weights.

Here's a simple example of using caching in system development:

#+BEGIN_SRC python :session :results output
from systems.provided.futures_chapter15.basesystem import futures_system
system=futures_system()

# step 2
system.accounts.portfolio.curve() ## effectively runs an entire backtest

# step 3
new_idm=1.1 ## new IDM
system.config.instrument_div_multiplier=new_idm

# step 4
system.delete_all_items() ## protected items won't be affected
system.accounts.portfolio.curve() ## re-run the backtest

# Assuming we're happy- move on to step 6 
system.delete_all_items(delete_protected=True) 

## or alternatively recreate the system using the modified config:
new_config=system.config
system=futures_system(config=new_config)

## Step 7
system.accounts.portfolio.curve() ## re-run the final backtest
#+END_SRC

**** Advanced caching behaviour with a live trading system

Although the project doesn't yet include a live trading system, the
caching behaviour of the system object will make it more suitable for a
live system. If we're trading slowly enough, eg every day, we might be
want to to do this overnight:

1. Get new prices for all instruments
2. Save these in wherever our data object is looking
3. Create a new system object from scratch
4. Run the system by asking for optimal positions for all instruments

Step 4 might be very involved and slow, but markets are closed so that's
fine.

Then we do the following throughout the day:

5. Wait for a new price to come in (perhaps through a message bus)
6. So we don't subsequently use stale prices delete everything specific
   to that instrument with =system.delete_items_for_instrument(instrument_code)=
7. Re-calculate the optimal positions for this instrument
8. This is then passed to our trading algo

Because we've deleted everything specific to the instrument we'll
recalculate the positions, and all intermediate stages, using the new
price. However we won't have to repeat lengthy calculations that cut
across instruments, such as correlation estimates, risk overlays, cross
sectional data or weight estimation. That can wait till our next
overnight run.

*** Very advanced: Caching in new or modified code

If you're going to write new methods for stages (or a complete new
stage) you need to follow some rules to keep caching behaviour
consistent.

The golden rule is a particular value should only be cached once, in a
single place.

So the data object methods should never cache; they should just behave
like 'pipes' passing data through to system stages on request. This
saves the hassle of having to write methods which delete items in the
data object cache as well as the system cache.

Similarly most stages contain 'input' methods, which do no calculations
but get the 'output' from an earlier stage and then 'serve' it to the
rest of the stage. These exist to simplify changing the internal wiring
of a stage and reduce the coupling between methods from different
stages. These should also never cache; or again we'll be caching the
same data multiple times ( see [[#stage_wiring][stage wiring]] ).

You should cache as early as possible; so that all the subsequent stages
that need that data item already have it. Avoid looping back, where a
stage uses data from a later stage, as you may end up with infinite
recursion.

The cache 'lives' in the parent system object in the attribute
=system._cache=, /not/ the stage with the relevant method. There are
standard functions which will check to see if an item is cached in the
system, and then call a function to calculate it if required (see
below). To make this easier when a stage object joins a system it gains
an attribute self.parent, which will be the 'parent' system.

The cache is a dictionary, whose keys are 3 tuples of strings: (stage
name, item name, flags). Item names should be the same as the methods
that call them, eg =system.portfolio.get_notional_position()= caches to
=system._cache[('portfolio', 'get_notional_position')]=. The flags
element defaults to an empty string, but is used mainly by the accounts
. Within each item element must be dictionaries, the keys of which are
instrument codes. You can also nest dictionaries, as when we store
forecasts for each instrument and trading rule variation.

Think carefully about wether your method should create data that is
protected from casual cache deletion. As a rule anything that cuts
across instruments and / or changes slowly should be protected. Here are
the current list of protected items:

-  Forecast scalars
-  Forecast weights
-  Forecast diversification multiplier
-  Forecast correlations
-  Instrument diversification multiplier
-  Instrument weights
-  Instrument correlations

To this list I'd add any cross sectional data, and anything that
measures portfolio risk (not yet implemented in this project).

Also think about whether you're going to cache any complex objects that
=pickle= might have trouble with, like class instances. You need to flag
these up as problematic.

Let's look at the [[../systems/forecast_combine.py][forecast_combine.py]] file for an
example of how to write caching code. This code is an annotated extract:

        """

        return self.parent.forecastScaleCap.get_capped_forecast(instrument_code, rule_variation_name)



    def get_combined_forecast(self, instrument_code):
        """
        Get a combined forecast, linear combination of individual forecasts with FDM applied

        """                    
        def _get_combined_forecast(system,  instrument_code,  this_stage ):
            ### this function gets called if the cache is empty
            ### by convention the current stage object (self) is called this_stage

            ## do some stuff
            return combined_forecast

        ## notice that self.parent will be the system object which contains the stage
        ## Notice the caching method takes as arguments the item name (same as the method), instrument code, private function to call 
            if we need to calculate, and the system stage (self)
            ##  There can be additional arguments

        return combined_forecast


#+END_SRC

And here is the [[../systems/basesystem.py][calc_or_cache function]]. If it doesn't find the dictname as an
attribute then it calls the calculation function (=_get_combined_forecast=) in
this case, for which the stage object (self) is the only *arg (and which then
becomes this_stage in the calculation function).

    return value

If a cache has to store more than one just one item per instrument, which is
common for the results of trading rule calculations, we should use the nested
version of =calc_or_cache=, as in this method from forecast_scale_cap.py:

#+BEGIN_SRC python :session :results output

        ## do some stuff
        return forecast_scalar

    """         
    forecast_scalar=self.parent.calc_or_cache_nested( "get_forecast_scalar", instrument_code, rule_variation_name, _get_forecast_scalar, self)

    return forecast_scalar
#+END_SRC

Every rule variation for every instrument has a different scalar (or at least
the potential to have one - in practice in the default config they would have
the same across all instruments). So we store the results in a nested dict. The
top level dict should always be organised by =instrument_code=, otherwise the
cache aware code in the system object won't work properly.

Again if a calculation function (like =_get_forecast_scalar=) needs the current
stage object (=self=) then we pass it in renaming it as =this_stage=.

For reference here is [[../systems/basesystem.py][calc_or_cache_nested]]. Notice that in the example above
keyname is the rule_variation_name and there are no *args.

*** Creating a new 'pre-baked' system

It's worth creating a new pre-baked system if you're likely to want to
repeat a backtest, or when you've settled on a system you want to paper
or live trade.

The elements of a new pre-baked system will be:

1. New stages, or a different choice of existing stages.
2. A set of data (either new or existing)
3. A configuration file
4. A python function that loads the above elements, and returns a system
   object

To remain organised it's good practice to save your configuration file and any
python functions you need into a directory like
=pysystemtrade/private/this_system_name/= (you'll need to create a couple of
directories first). If you plan to contribute to github, just be careful to
avoid adding 'private' to your commit ( [[https://24ways.org/2013/keeping-parts-of-your-codebase-private-on-github/][you may want to read this]] ). If you have
novel data you're using for this system, you may also want to save it in the
same directory.

Then it's a case of creating the python function. Here is an extract from the

** Stages
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       2A0123A9-6E2E-4854-8BFA-84905ED6B449
:END:

A /stage/ within a system does part of the multiple steps of calculation
that are needed to ultimately come up with the optimal positions, and
hence the account curve, for the system. So the backtesting or live
trading process effectively happens within the stage objects.

We define the stages in a system when we create it, by passing a list of
stage objects as the first argument:

#+BEGIN_SRC python :session :results output
from systems.forecasting import Rules
from systems.basesystem import System
data=None ## this won't do anything useful

## This is preferred, except for Rules() (see  [[switching class][switching object persistence]]) )
my_system=System([Rules()], data)


## However this will also usually work  (see [[switching class][switching object persistence]]) )
my_rules=Rules() ## create an instance of this particular stage class
my_system=System([my_rules], data)
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_example

  File "<stdin>", line 2, in <module>
  File "/Users/lriley/.ghq/github.com/analyticd/pysystemtrade/systems/basesystem.py", line 64, in __init__
    setattr(data, "log", log.setup(stage="data"))

    setattr(data, "log", log.setup(stage="data"))
AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'log'
#+end_example

(This step is often hidden when we use 'pre-baked' systems)

We can see what stages are in a system just by printing it:

#+BEGIN_SRC python :session :results output
from systems.provided.futures_chapter15.basesystem import futures_system
system=futures_system()
system
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
System with stages: accounts, portfolio, positionSize, rawdata, combForecast, forecastScaleCap, rules
#+END_EXAMPLE

Stages are attributes of the main system:

#+BEGIN_SRC python :session :results output
from systems.provided.futures_chapter15.basesystem import futures_system
system=futures_system()
system.rawdata
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
SystemStage 'rawdata'
#+END_EXAMPLE

So we can access the data methods of each stage:

#+BEGIN_SRC python :session :results output
system.rawdata.get_raw_price("EDOLLAR").tail(5)
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
              price
2015-04-16  97.9350
2015-04-17  97.9400
2015-04-20  97.9250
2015-04-21  97.9050
2015-04-22  97.8325
#+END_EXAMPLE

=system.rawdata.log= provides access to the log for the stage rawdata,
and so on. See [logging][#logging] for more details.

*** Switching classes and persistence

Mostly the system is agnostic between

#+BEGIN_SRC python :session :results output
from systems.provided.futures_chapter15.basesystem import *
data = csvFuturesData()
config = Config(
    "systems.provided.futures_chapter15.futuresestimateconfig.yaml")

## Option A:
system = System([Account(), Portfolios(), PositionSizing(), FuturesRawData(), ForecastCombine(),
                 ForecastScaleCap(), Rules()], data, config)

## Option B:
account=Account()
portfolios=Portfolios()
rawdata=FuturesRawData()
combine=ForecastCombine()
fcs=ForecastScaleCap()
rules=Rules()
psize=PositionSizing()

system = System([account,portfolios, psize, rawdata, combine,
                 fcs, rules], data, config)

## Option C
## You can also mix and match
system = System([Account(), Portfolios(), PositionSizing(), FuturesRawData(), ForecastCombine(),
                 ForecastScaleCap(), rules], data, config)
#+END_SRC

Indeed option B or C is often preferable when developing new [[#TradingRules][trading rules]].

However you need to be careful with these 3 objects:

#+BEGIN_SRC python :session :results output
## DO NOT DO THIS
portfolios=Portfolios()
combine=ForecastCombine()
fcs=ForecastScaleCap()
#+END_SRC

I strongly recommend that you do not do this. The reason is that these
objects dynamically switch into either an estimating or a fixed flavour
once they become part of a system, depending on the value of
=use_*_estimates= config paramters. If for some reasons you're switching
between using fixed and estimated weights during a backtesting session,
then you might expect that you just need to change the config, and of
course create a new system object. However the above objects will retain
their old status as fixed or estimated versions of the relevant class.

So you need to remember to create brand new instances of the relevant
stages (as I do in the introductory guide); or better still just create
them within the system call.

*** Stage 'wiring'

It's worth having a basic understanding of how the stages within a
system are 'wired' together. Futhermore if you're going to modify or
create new code, or use [[#caching][advanced system caching]], you're
going to need to understand this properly.

What actually happens when we call
=system.combForecast.get_combined_forecast("EDOLLAR")= in the pre-baked futures
system? Well this in turn will call other methods in this stage, and they will
call methods in previous stages,.. and so on until we get back to the underlying
data. We can represent this with a diagram:

-  =system.combForecast.get_combined_forecast("EDOLLAR")=
-  =system.combForecast.get_forecast_diversification_multiplier("EDOLLAR")=
-  =system.combForecast.get_forecast_weights("EDOLLAR")=
-  =system.combForecast.get_capped_forecast("EDOLLAR", "ewmac2_8"))= etc

  -  =system.forecastScaleCap.get_capped_forecast("EDOLLAR", "ewmac2_8"))=
    etc
  -  =system.forecastScaleCap.get_forecast_cap("EDOLLAR", "ewmac2_8")=
    etc
  -  =system.forecastScaleCap.get_scaled_forecast("EDOLLAR", "ewmac2_8")=
    etc

    -  =system.forecastScaleCap.get_forecast_scalar("EDOLLAR",  "ewmac2_8")=
      etc
    -  =system.forecastScaleCap.get_raw_forecast("EDOLLAR",  "ewmac2_8")=
      etc
    -  =system.rules.get_raw_forecast("EDOLLAR",  "ewmac2_8")= etc

      -  =system.data.get_raw_price("EDOLLAR")=
      -  =system.rawdata.get_daily_returns_volatility("EDOLLAR")=
      -  (further stages to calculate volatility omitted)

A system effectively consists of a 'tree' of which the above shows only
a small part. When we ask for a particular 'leaf' of the tree, the data
travels up the 'branches' of the tree, being cached as it goes.

The stage 'wiring' is how the various stages communicate with each
other. Generally a stage will consist of:

1. Input methods that get data from another stage without doing any
   further calculation
2. Internal methods that do intermediate calculations within a stage
   (these may be private, but are usually left exposed so they can be
   used for diagnostic purposes)
3. Output methods that other stages will use for their inputs.

For example consider the first few items in the list above. Let's label
them appropriately:

-  *Output (combForecast)*:
  =system.combForecast.get_combined_forecast("EDOLLAR")=
-  *Internal (combForecast)*:
  =system.combForecast.get_forecast_diversification_multiplier("EDOLLAR")=
-  *Internal (combForecast)*:
  =system.combForecast.get_forecast_weights("EDOLLAR")=
-  *Input (combForecast)*:
  =system.combForecast.get_capped_forecast("EDOLLAR", "ewmac2_8"))= etc

  -  *Output (forecastScaleCap)*:
    =system.forecastScaleCap.get_capped_forecast("EDOLLAR", "ewmac2_8"))=
    etc

This approach (which you can also think of as the stage "API") is used
to make it easier to modify the code - we can change the way a stage
works internally, or replace it with a new stage with the same name, but
as long as we keep the output method intact we don't need to mess around
with any other stage.

*** Using a different set of stages

There are different versions of certain stages available; for example we
can use either =ForecastScaleCapFixed= or =ForecastScaleCapEstimated=.
Additionally you can add new kinds of stages if desired (see below), and
remove stages you don't need (though you can't remove intermediate
stages that a remaining stage would need to work out its results).

It's best to create a new 'pre-baked' system by copying and modifying a file
such as [[../systems/provided/futures_chapter_15/basesystem.py][this]]. You need to import the new stages you require and then put them
into the system, like so:

#+BEGIN_SRC python :session :results output
from systems.provided.futures_chapter15 import *
from systems.combForecast import ForecastCombinedEstimated

def futures_system( data=None, config=None, trading_rules=None):
    """
    code to import default data and config would go here
    """

    ## build the system with different stages
    system=System([Account(), PortfoliosFixed(), PositionSizing(), FuturesRawData(), ForecastCombineEstimated(), 
                   ForecastScaleCapFixed(), Rules(trading_rules)], data, config)

    return system
#+END_SRC

*** Writing new stages

If you're going to write a new stage (completely new, or to replace an
existing stage) you need to keep the following in mind:

1.  New stages should inherit from
   [[../systems/stage/SystemStage][SystemStage]]
2.  Modified stages should inherit from the existing stage you're
   modifying. For example if you create a new way of calculating
   forecast weights then you should inherit from
   [[../systems/forecast_combine.py][class ForecastCombineFixed]], and
   then override the =get_forecast_weights= method; whilst keeping the
   other methods unchanged.
3.  New stages will need a unique name; this is stored in the object
   attribute =name=. They can then be accessed with =system.stage_name=
4.  Modified stages should use the same name as their parent, or the
   wiring will go haywire. They should however use a different
   description, which goes in the attribute =description= attribute.
5.  Consider using a /[[#switch_persistence][switching]]/ stage like
   [[../systems/forecast_combine.py][class ForecastCombine]] (there are similar switches for forecast scaling and
   portfolios).
6.  Think about whether you need to protect part of the system cache for
   this stage output [[#caching][system caching]]. To do this create a
   list in the attribute =_protected= with the item names you wish to
   protect. 6a. Similarly if you're going to cache complex objects that
   won't pickle easily (like accountCurve objects) you need to add the
   item name to the attribute '_nopickle'.
7.  If you're inheriting from another stage be sure to add to its list
   of protected items, rather than replacing it.
8.  Use non-cached input methods to get data from other stages. Be wary
   of accessing internal methods in other stages; try to stick to
   output methods only.
9.  Use cached input methods to get data from the system data object
   (since this is the first time it will be cached). Again only access
   public methods of the system data object.
10. Use cached methods for internal and output methods(see
    [[#caching][system caching]] ). Cache keys for items should be the
    same as the method name.
11. If you want to store attributes within a stage, then prefix them
    with _ and include a method to access or change them. Otherwise the
    methods() method will return attributes as well as methods.
12. Internal methods should be public if they could be used for
    diagnostics, otherwise prefix them with _ to make them private.
13. The doc string for input and output methods should clearly identify
    them as such. This is to make viewing the wiring easier.
14. The doc string at the head of the stage should specify the input
    methods (and where they take their input from), and the output
    methods
15. The doc string should also explain what the stage does, and the name
    of the stage
16. It can make sense to blend methods from existing stages, for example
    if you want to use fixed forecast weights but estimate the forecast
    div. multiplier dynamically you can create a copy of
    =ForecastCombineEstimated= which does not override the
    get_raw_forecast_weights method.

Here's an example of a base class, to use as a template for new classes

Each of these stages is described in more detail below.

*** Stage: Raw data

The raw data stage is used to pre-process data for calculating trading
rules, scaling positions, or anything else we might. Good reasons to
include something in raw data are:

1. If it is used multiple times, eg price volatility
2. To provide better diagnostics and visibility in the system, eg the
   intermediate steps required to calculate the carry rule for futures

**** Using the standard [[../systems/rawdata.py][RawData class]]

The base RawData class includes methods to get instrument prices, daily
returns, volatility, and normalised returns (return over volatility).

***** Volatility calculation

There are two types of volatility in my trading systems:

1. Price difference volatility eg sigma (Pt - Pt-1)
2. Percentage return volatility eg sigma (Pt - Pt -1 / P*t-1)

The first kind is used in trading rules to normalise the forecast into
something proportional to Sharpe Ratio. The second kind is used to scale
positions. In both cases we use a 'stitched' price to work out price
differences. So in futures we splice together futures contracts as we
roll, shifting them according to the Panama method. Similarly if the
system dealt with cash equities, it would handle ex-dividend dates in
the same way. If we didn't do this, but just used the 'natural' price
(the raw price of the contract we're trading) to calculate returns, we'd
get sharp returns on rolls.

In fact stitched prices are used by default in the system; since they
make more sense for trading rules that usually prefer smoother prices
without weird jumps. Nearly all the methods in raw data that mention
price are referring to the stitched price.

However when working out percentage returns we absolutely don't want to
use the 'stitched' price as the denominator. For positive carry assets
stitched prices will increase over time; this means they will be small
or even negative in the past and the percentage returns will be large or
have the wrong sign.

For this reason there is a special method in the data class called
=daily_denominator_price=. This tells the code what price to use for the
P* in the calculation above. In the base class this defaults to the
stitched price (but in the futures class, described below, it uses the
raw price of the current contract).

The other point to note is that the price difference volatility
calculation is configurable through =config.volatility_calculation=.

The default function used is a robust EWMA volatility calculator with
the following configurable attributes:

-  35 day span
-  Needs 10 periods to generate a value
-  Will floor any values less than 0.0000000001
-  Applys a further vol floor which:
-  Calculates the 5% percentile of vol using a 500 day moving average
  (needing 100 periods to generate a value)
-  Floors any vol below that level

YAML:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
volatility_calculation:
  func: "syscore.algos.robust_vol_calc"
  days: 35
  min_periods: 10
  vol_abs_min: 0.0000000001 
  vol_floor: True
  floor_min_quant: 0.05
  floor_min_periods: 100
  floor_days: 500
#+END_EXAMPLE

If you're considering using your own function please see [[#config_function_defaults][configuring defaults
for your own functions]]

**** Using the [[../systems/futures/rawdata.py][FuturesRawData class]]

The futures raw data class has some extra methods needed to calculate
the carry rule for futures, and to expose the intermediate calculations.
It also overrides =daily_denominator_price= with the raw price of the
futures contract currently traded (as noted [[#vol_calc][above]] ).

**** New or modified raw data classes

It would make sense to create new raw data classes for new types of
assets, or to get more visibility inside trading rule calculations.

For example:

1. To work out the quality factor for an equity value system, based on
   raw accounting ratios
2. To work out the moving averages to be used in an EWMAC trading rule,
   so they can be viewed for diagnostic purposes.

For new asset classes in particular you should think hard about what you
should override the =daily_denominator_price= (see discussion on
volatility calculation above).

*** Stage: Rules

Trading rules are at the heart of a fully systematic trading system.
This stage description is different from the others; and will be in the
form of a tutorial around creating trading rules.

The base class, Rules() [[../systems/forecasting.py][is here]]; and it
shouldn't be neccessary to modify this class.

*** Trading rules

A trading rule consists of:

-  a function
-  some data (specified as positional arguments)
-  some optional control arguments (specified as key word arguments)

So the function must be something like these:

#+BEGIN_SRC python :session :results output
def trading_rule_function(data1):
    ## do something with data1

def trading_rule_function(data1, arg1=default_value):
    ## do something with data1
    ## controlled by value of arg1

def trading_rule_function(data1, data2):
    ## do something with data1 and data2

def trading_rule_function(data1, data2, arg1=default_value, arg2=default_value):
    ## do something with data1
    ## controlled by value of arg1 and arg2
#+END_SRC

... and so on.

At a minimum we need to know the function, since other arguments are optional,
and if no data is specified the instrument price is used. A rule specified with
only the function is a 'bare' rule. It should take only one data argument which
is price, and have no other arguments that need new parameter values.

In this project there is a specific [[../systems/forecasting.py][TradingRule class]]. A =TradingRule= instance
contains 3 elements - a function, a list of any data the function needs, and a
dict of any other arguments that can be passed to the function.

The function can either be the actual function, or a relative reference to it eg
"systems.provided.futures_chapter15.rules.ewmac" (this is useful when a
configuration is created from a file). Data must always be in the form of
references to attributes and methods of the system object, eg
'data.daily_prices' or 'rawdata.get_daily_prices'. Either a single data item,
or a list must be passed. Other arguments are in the form a dictionary.

We can create trading rules in a number of different ways. I've noticed that
different people find different ways of defining rules more natural than others,
hence the deliberate flexibility here.

Bare rules can be defined as follows:

#+BEGIN_SRC python :session :results output
from systems.forecasting import TradingRule

TradingRule(ewmac) ## with only the function
TradingRule("systems.provided.futures_chapter15.rules.ewmac") ## string reference to the function
#+END_SRC

We can also add data and other arguments:

#+BEGIN_SRC python :session :results output
TradingRule(ewmac, data='rawdata.get_daily_prices', other_args=dict(Lfast=2, Lslow=8)) 
#+END_SRC

Multiple data is fine, and it's okay to omit data or other_args:

#+BEGIN_SRC python :session :results output
TradingRule(some_rule, data=['rawdata.get_daily_prices','data.get_raw_price'])
#+END_SRC

Sometimes it's easier to specify the rule 'en bloc'. You can do this
with a 3 tuple. Notice here we're specifying the function with a string,
and listing multiple data items:

#+BEGIN_SRC python :session :results output
TradingRule(("systems.provided.futures_chapter15.rules.ewmac", ['rawdata.get_daily_prices','data.get_raw_price'], dict(Lfast=3, Lslow=12)))
#+END_SRC

Or with a dict. If using a dict keywords can be omitted (but not
=function=).

#+BEGIN_SRC python :session :results output
TradingRule(dict(function="systems.provided.futures_chapter15.rules.ewmac", data=['rawdata.get_daily_prices','data.get_raw_price']))
#+END_SRC

Note if you use an 'en bloc' method, and also include the =data= or
=other_args= arguments in your call to =TradingRule=, you'll get a
warning.

The dictionary method is used when configuration objects are read from
YAML files; these contain the trading rules in a nested dict.

YAML: (example)

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
trading_rules:
  ewmac2_8:
     function: systems.futures.rules.ewmac
     data:
         - "data.daily_prices"
         - "rawdata.daily_returns_volatility"
     other_args: 
         Lfast: 2
         Lslow: 8
     forecast_scalar: 10.6
#+END_EXAMPLE

Note that /=forecast_scalar=/ isn't strictly part of the trading rule definition,
but if included here will be used instead of the seperate =config.forecast_scalar=
parameter (see the [[#stage_scale][next stage]] ).

*** The Rules class, and specifying lists of trading rules

We can pass a trading rule, or a group of rules, into the class Rules()
in a number of ways.

**** Creating lists of rules from a configuration object

Normally we'd pass in the list of rules form a configuration object.
Let's have a look at an incomplete version of the pre-baked chapter 15
futures system.

#+BEGIN_SRC python :session :results output
## We probably need these to get our data

from sysdata.csvdata import csvFuturesData
from sysdata.configdata import Config
from systems.basesystem import System

## We now import all the stages we need
from systems.forecasting import Rules
from systems.futures.rawdata import FuturesRawData

data=csvFuturesData()
config=Config("systems.provided.futures_chapter15.futuresconfig.yaml")

rules=Rules()

## build the system
system=System([rules, FuturesRawData()], data, config)

rules
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
Rules object with unknown trading rules [try Rules.tradingrules() ]
#+END_EXAMPLE

#+BEGIN_SRC python :session :results output
## 
forecast=system.rules.get_raw_forecast('EDOLLAR','ewmac2_8')
rules
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
Rules object with rules ewmac32_128, ewmac64_256, ewmac16_64, ewmac8_32, ewmac4_16, ewmac2_8, carry
#+END_EXAMPLE

#+BEGIN_SRC python :session :results output
## 
rules.trading_rules()
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
{'carry': TradingRule; function: <function carry at 0xb2e0f26c>, data: rawdata.daily_annualised_roll, rawdata.daily_returns_volatility and other_args: smooth_days,
 'ewmac16_64': TradingRule; function: <function ewmac at 0xb2e0f224>, data: rawdata.daily_prices, rawdata.daily_returns_volatility and other_args: Lfast, Lslow,
 'ewmac2_8': TradingRule; function: <function ewmac at 0xb2e0f224>, data: rawdata.daily_prices, rawdata.daily_returns_volatility and other_args: Lfast, Lslow,
 'ewmac32_128': TradingRule; function: <function ewmac at 0xb2e0f224>, data: rawdata.daily_prices, rawdata.daily_returns_volatility and other_args: Lfast, Lslow,
 'ewmac4_16': TradingRule; function: <function ewmac at 0xb2e0f224>, data: rawdata.daily_prices, rawdata.daily_returns_volatility and other_args: Lfast, Lslow,
 'ewmac64_256': TradingRule; function: <function ewmac at 0xb2e0f224>, data: rawdata.daily_prices, rawdata.daily_returns_volatility and other_args: Lfast, Lslow,
 'ewmac8_32': TradingRule; function: <function ewmac at 0xb2e0f224>, data: rawdata.daily_prices, rawdata.daily_returns_volatility and other_args: Lfast, Lslow}
#+END_EXAMPLE

What actually happens when we run this? (this is a little complex but
worth understanding).

1. The =Rules= class is created with no arguments.
2. We create the =system= object. This means that all the stages can see
   the system, in particular they can see the configuration
3. When the =Rules= object is first created it is 'empty' - it doesn't
   have a list of valid /processed/ trading rules.
4. =get_raw_forecast= is called, and looks for the trading rule
   "ewmac2_8". It gets this by calling the method =get_trading_rules=
5. When the method =get_trading_rules= is called it looks to see if
   there is a /processed/ dict of trading rules
6. The first time the method =get_trading_rules= is called there won't
   be a processed list. So it looks for something to process
7. First it will look to see if anything was passed when the instance
   rules of the =Rules()= class was created
8. Since we didn't pass anything instead it processes what it finds in
   =system.config.trading_rules= - a nested dict, keynames rule
   variation names.
9. The =Rules= instance now has processed rule names in the form of a
   dict, keynames rule variation names, each element containing a valid
   =TradingRule= object

**** Interactively passing a list of trading rules

Often when we're working in development mode we won't have worked up a
proper config. To get round this we can pass a single trading rule or a
set of trading rules to the =Rules()= instance when we create it. If we
pass a dict, then the rules will be given appropriate names, otherwise
if a single rule or a list is passed they will be given arbitrary names
"rule0", "rule1", ...

Also note that we don't have pass a single rule, list or dict of rules;
we can also pass anything that can be processed into a trading rule.

#+BEGIN_SRC python :session :results output
## We now import all the stages we need
from systems.forecasting import Rules

## Pass a single rule. Any of the following are fine. See [defining TradingRule objects](#TradingRules) for more.
trading_rule=TradingRule(ewmac)
trading_rule=(ewmac, 'rawdata.get_daily_prices', dict(Lfast=2, Lslow=8)) 
trading_rule=dict(function=ewmac, data='rawdata.get_daily_prices', other_args=dict(Lfast=2, Lslow=8)) 

rules=Rules(trading_rule)
## The rulea will be given an arbitrary name

## Pass a list of rules. Each rule can be defined how you like
trading_rule1=(ewmac, 'rawdata.get_daily_prices', dict(Lfast=2, Lslow=8)) 
trading_rule2=dict(function=ewmac, other_args=dict(Lfast=4, Lslow=16)) 

rules=Rules([trading_rule1, tradingrule2])
## The rules will be given arbitrary names

## Pass a dict of rules. Each rule can be defined how you like
trading_rule1=(ewmac, 'rawdata.get_daily_prices', dict(Lfast=2, Lslow=8)) 
trading_rule2=dict(function=ewmac, other_args=dict(Lfast=4, Lslow=16)) 

rules=Rules(dict(ewmac2_8=trading_rule1, ewmac4_16=tradingrule2))

#+END_SRC

**** Creating variations on a single trading rule

A very common development pattern is to create a trading rule with some
parameters that can be changed, and then to produce a number of
variations. Two functions are provided to make this easier.

#+BEGIN_SRC python :session :results output
from systems.forecasting import create_variations_oneparameter, create_variations, TradingRule

## Let's create 3 variations of ewmac
## The default ewmac has Lslow=128
## Let's keep that fixed and vary Lfast
rule=TradingRule("systems.provided.example.rules.ewmac_forecast_with_defaults")
trading_rules=create_variations_oneparameter(rule, [4,10,100], "ewmac_Lfast")

variations.keys()
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
dict_keys(['ewmac_Lfast_4', 'ewmac_Lfast_10', 'ewmac_Lfast_100'])
#+END_EXAMPLE

#+BEGIN_SRC python :session :results output
## Now let's vary both Lslow and Lfast
rule=TradingRule("systems.provided.example.rules.ewmac_forecast_with_defaults")
trading_rules=create_variations_oneparameter(rule, [4,10,100], "Lfast")
variations=create_variations(rule, [dict(Lfast=2, Lslow=8), dict(Lfast=4, Lslow=16)], argname="Lfast")

variations.keys()
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
dict_keys(['ewmac_Lfast_4', 'ewmac_Lfast_2'])
#+END_EXAMPLE

We'd now create an instance of =Rules()=, passing variations in as an
argument.

**** Using a newly created Rules() instance

Once we have our new rules object we can create a new system with it:

#+BEGIN_SRC python :session :results output
## build the system
system=System([rules, FuturesRawData()], data, config)  
#+END_SRC

It's generally a good idea to put new fixed forecast scalars (see [[#stage_scale][forecasting
scaling and capping]] ) and forecast weights into the config (see [[#stage_combine][the combining
stage]] ); although if you're estimating these parameters automatically this won't
be a problem. Or if you're just playing with ideas you can live with the default
forecast scale of 1.0, and you can delete the forecast weights so that the
system will default to using equal weights:

#+BEGIN_SRC python :session :results output
del(config.forecast_weights)
#+END_SRC

**** Passing trading rules to a pre-baked system function

If we've got a pre-baked system and a new set of trading rules we want
to try that aren't in a config, we can pass them into the system when
it's created:

#+BEGIN_SRC python :session :results output
from systems.provided.futures_chapter15.basesystem import futures_system

## we now create my_rules as we did above, for example
trading_rule1=(ewmac, 'rawdata.get_daily_prices', dict(Lfast=2, Lslow=8)) 
trading_rule2=dict(function=ewmac, other_args=dict(Lfast=4, Lslow=16)) 

system=futures_system(trading_rules=dict(ewmac2_8=trading_rule1, ewmac4_16=tradingrule2)) ## we may need to change the configuration
#+END_SRC

**** Changing the trading rules in a system on the fly (advanced)

The workflow above has been to create a =Rules= instance (either empty,
or passing in a set of trading rules), then create a system that uses
it. However sometimes we might want to modify the list of trading rules
in the system object. For example you may have loaded a pre-baked system
in (which will have an empty =Rules()= instance and so be using the
rules from the config). Rather than replace that wholesale, you might
want to drop one of the rules, add an additional one, or change a rule
that already exists.

To do this we need to directly access the private =_trading_rules=
attribute that stores *processed* trading rules in a dict. This means we
can't pass in any old rubbish that can be parsed into a trading rule as
we did above; we need to pass in actual =TradingRule= objects.

#+BEGIN_SRC python :session :results output
from systems.provided.futures_chapter15.basesystem import futures_system
from systems.forecasting import TradingRule

system=futures_system()

## Parse the existing rules in the config (not required if you're going to backtest first as this will call this method doing its normal business)
system.rules.trading_rules()


#############
## add a rule by accessing private attribute
new_rule=TradingRule("systems.provided.futures_chapter15.rules.ewmac") ## any form of [TradingRule](#TradingRule) is fine here
system.rules._trading_rules['new_rule']=new_rule 
#############


#############
## modify a rule with existing key 'ewmac2_8'
modified_rule=system.rules._trading_rules['ewmac2_8']
modified_rule.other_args['Lfast']=10

## We can also do:
## modified_rule.function=new_function
## modified_rule.data='data.get_raw_price'
##

system.rules._trading_rules['ewmac2_8']=modified_rule 
#############


#############
## delete a rule (not recommended)
## Removing the rule from the set of fixed forecast_weights or rule_variations (used for estimating forecast_weights) would have the same effect - and you need to do this anyway
## Rules which aren't in the list of variations or weights are not calculated, so there is no benefit in deleting a rule in terms of speed / space
##
system.rules._trading_rules.pop("ewmac2_8")
#############
#+END_SRC

*** Stage: Forecast scale and cap
[[../systems/forecast_scale_cap.py][ForecastScaleCap class]]

This is a simple stage that performs two steps:

1. Scale forecasts so they have the right average absolute value, by
   multipling raw forecasts by a forecast scalar
2. Cap forecasts at a maximum value

Warning: Be careful about changing a system from estimated to non estimated 'on
the fly' by varying the estimation parameters (in the form use_*_estimates). See
[[#][persistence of 'switched' stage objects]] for more information.

This is a [[#switch_persistence]["switching" class]]. If =config.use_forecast_scale_estimates= is False
(default) we'll use the fixed flavour. Otherwise we'll use the estimated
flavour.

**** Using the standard [[../systems/forecast_scale_cap.py][ForecastScaleCapFixed class]]

The standard 'fixed' class uses fixed scaling and caps. It is included
in [[#futures_system][standard futures system]].

Forecast scalars are specific to each rule. Scalars can either be
included in the =trading_rules= or =forecast_scalars= part of the
config. The former takes precedence if both are included:

YAML: (example)

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
trading_rules:
  rule_name:
     function: systems.futures.rules.arbitrary_function
     forecast_scalar: 10.6
#+END_EXAMPLE

YAML: (example)

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
forecast_scalars: 
   rule_name: 10.6
#+END_EXAMPLE

The forecast cap is also configurable, but must be the same for all
rules:

YAML:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
forecast_cap: 20.0
#+END_EXAMPLE

If entirely missing values of 1.0 and 20.0 are used for the scale and
cap respectively.

**** Calculating forecasting scaling on the fly with
[[../systems/forecast_scale_cap.py][ForecastScaleCapEstimated class]]

See [[http://qoppac.blogspot.co.uk/2016/01/pysystemtrader-estimated-forecast.html][this blog post]].

You may prefer to estimate your forecast scales from the available data. This is
often neccessary if you have a new trading rule and have no idea at all what the
scaling should be. To do this you need to use the =ForecastScaleCapEstimated=
child class, rather than the fixed flavour, by setting
=config.use_forecast_scale_estimates=True=. This inherits from the fixed base
class, so capping works in exactly the same way, but replaces the method for
get_forecast_scalar. It is included in the pre-baked [[#futures_system][estimated futures system]].

All the config parameters needed are stored in =config.forecast_scalar_estimate=.

You can either estimate scalars for individual instruments, or using
data pooled across instruments. The config parameter =pool_instruments=
determines which option is used.

***** Pooled forecast scale estimate (default)

We do this if =pool_instruments=True=. This defaults to using the function
"syscore.algos.forecast_scalar", but this is configurable using the parameter
=func=. If you're changing this please see [[#config_function_defaults][configuring defaults for your own
functions]].

I strongly recommend using pooling, since it's always good to get more
data. The only reason not to use it is if you've been an idiot and
designed a forecast for which the scale is naturally different across
instruments (see chapter 7 of my book).

This function calculates a cross sectional median of absolute values,
then works out the scalar to get it 10, using a rolling moving average
(so always out of sample).

I also recommend using the defaults, a =window= size of 250000
(essentially long enough so you're estimating with an expanding window)
and =min_periods= of 500 (a couple of years of daily data; less than
this and we'll get something too unstable especially for a slower
trading rule, more and we'll have to wait too long to get a value). The
other parameter of interest is =backfill= which is boolean and defaults
to True. This backfills the first scalar value found back into the past
so we don't lose any data; strictly speaking this is cheating but we're
not selecting the parameter for performance reasons so I for one can
sleep at night.

Note: The pooled estimate is [[#caching][cached]] as an 'across system', non instrument
specific, item.

***** Individual instrument forecast scale estimate

We do this if =pool_instruments=False=. Other parameters work in the
same way.

Note: The estimate is [[#caching][cached]] seperately for each instrument.

**** New or modified forecast scaling and capping

Possible changes here could include putting in response functions (as described
in [[http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2695101][this AHL paper]] ).

*** Stage: Forecast combine [[/systems/forecast_combine.py][ForecastCombine class]]

We now take a weighted average of forecasts using instrument weights,
and multiply by the forecast diversification multiplier.

This is a [[#switch_persistence]["switching" class]]. If =config.use_forecast_weight_estimates= is False
(default) we'll use the fixed flavour. Otherwise we'll use the estimated
flavour.

**** Using the standard [[../systems/forecast_combine.py][ForecastCombineFixed class]]

The current standard 'fixed' class uses fixed weights and a fixed multiplier. It
is included in the pre-baked [[#futures_system][standard futures system]].

Both weights and multiplier are configurable.

Forecast weights can be (a) common across instruments, or (b) specified
differently for each instrument. If not included equal weights will be
used.

YAML: (a)

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
forecast_weights:
     ewmac: 0.50
     carry: 0.50
#+END_EXAMPLE

YAML: (b)

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
forecast_weights:
     SP500:
      ewmac: 0.50
      carry: 0.50
     US10:
      ewmac: 0.10
      carry: 0.90
#+END_EXAMPLE

The diversification multiplier can also be (a) common across
instruments, or (b) we use a different one for each instrument (would be
normal if instrument weights were also different).

YAML: (a)

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
forecast_div_multiplier: 1.0
#+END_EXAMPLE

YAML: (b)

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
forecast_div_multiplier:
     SP500: 1.4
     US10:  1.1
#+END_EXAMPLE

Note that the =get_combined_forecast= method in the standard fixed base
class automatically adjusts forecast weights if different trading rules
have different start dates for their forecasts. It does not adjust the
multiplier. This means that in the past the multiplier will probably be
too high.

**** Using the [[../systems/forecast_combine.py][ForecastCombineEstimated class]]

This class currently estimates the correct diversification multiplier 'on the
fly', and also estimate forecast weights. It is included in the pre-baked
[[#futures_system][estimated futures system]]. We switch to it by setting
=config.use_forecast_weight_estimates=True=.

***** Estimating the forecast weights

See [[#optimisation][optimisation]] for more information.

***** Estimating the forecast diversification multiplier

See [[#divmult][estimating diversification multipliers]].

**** Writing new or modified forecast combination stages

I have no plans to write new stages here.

*** Stage: Position scaling

We now scale our positions according to our percentage volatility target
(chapters 9 and 10 of my book). At this stage we treat our target, and therefore
our account size, as fixed. So we ignore any compounding of losses and profits.
It's for this reason the I refer to the 'notional' position. In a later version
of the project I'll deal with this problem.

**** Using the standard [[../systems/positionsizing.py][PositionSizing class]]

The annualised percentage volatility target, notional trading capital
and currency of trading capital are all configurable.

YAML:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
percentage_vol_target: 16.0
notional_trading_capital: 1000000
base_currency: "USD"
#+END_EXAMPLE

Note that the stage code tries to get the percentage volatility of an
instrument from the rawdata stage. Since a rawdata stage might be
omitted, it can also fall back to calculating this from scratch using
the data object and the default volatility calculation method.

*** Stage: Creating portfolios [[/systems/portfolio.py][Portfolios class]]

The instrument weights are used to combine different instruments together into
the final portfolio (chapter eleven of my book).

This is a [[#switch_persistence]["switching" class]]. If =config.use_instrument_weight_estimates= is False
(default) we'll use the fixed flavour. Otherwise we'll use the estimated
flavour.

**** Using the standard [[../systems/portfolio.py][PortfoliosFixed class]]

The standard class uses fixed weights and multiplier.

Both are configurable. If omitted equal weights will be used, and a multiplier
of 1.0

YAML:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
instrument_weights:
    EDOLLAR: 0.5
    US10: 0.5
instrument_div_multiplier: 1.2
#+END_EXAMPLE

Note that the =get_instrument_weights= method in the standard fixed base
class automatically adjusts raw forecast weights if different
instruments have different start dates for their price history and
forecasts. It does not adjust the multiplier. This means that in the
past the multiplier will probably be too high.

Warning: Be careful about changing a system from estimated to non estimated 'on
the fly' by varying the estimation parameters (in the form use_*_estimates). See
[[#][persistence of 'switched' stage objects]] for more information.

**** Using the [[../systems/portfolio.py][PortfoliosEstimated class]]

This class currently estimates the correct instrument diversification
multiplier 'on the fly', and also estimates instrument weights. It is
included in the pre-baked [[#futures_system][estimated futures system]].
It is accessed by setting =config.use_instrument_weight_estimates=True=.

***** Estimating the instrument weights

See [[#optimisation][optimisation]] for more information.

***** Estimating the forecast diversification multiplier

See [[#divmult][estimating diversification multipliers]].

**** Buffering and position intertia

Position inertia, or buffering, is a way of reducing trading costs. The idea is
that we avoid trading if our optimal position changes only slightly by applying
a 'no trade' buffer around the current position. There is more on this subject
in chapter 11 of my book.

There are two methods that I use. /Position/ buffering is the same as the position
inertia method used in my book. We compare the current position to the optimal
position. If it's not within 10% (the 'buffer') then we trade to the optimal
position, otherwise we don't bother.

This configuration will implement position intertia as in my book.

YAML:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
buffer_trade_to_edge: False
buffer_method: position
buffer_size: 0.10
#+END_EXAMPLE

The second method is /forecast/ buffering. Here we take a proportion of the
average absolute position (what we get with a forecast of 10), and use that to
size the buffer width. This is more theoretically correct; since the buffer
doesn't shrink as we get to zero. Secondly if outside the buffer we trade to the
nearest edge of the buffer, rather than going to the optimal position. This
further reduces transaction costs. Here are my recommended settings for forecast
buffering:

YAML:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
buffer_trade_to_edge: True
buffer_method: forecast
buffer_size: 0.10
#+END_EXAMPLE

Note that buffering can work on both rounded and unrounded positions. In the
case of rounded positions we round the lower limit of the buffer, and the upper
limit.

These python methods allow you to see buffering in action.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
system.portfolio.get_notional_position("US10") ## get the position before buffering
system.portfolio.get_buffers_for_position("US10") ## get the upper and lower edges of the buffer
system.accounts.get_buffered_position("US10", roundpositions=True) ## get the buffered position.
#+END_EXAMPLE

Note that in a live trading system buffering should be done downstream of the
system module, in a process which can also see the actual current positions we
hold.

**** Writing new or modified portfolio stages

I'll update this to allow for variable capital.

*** Stage: Accounting
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       81E5C184-6F1D-4A40-BA8D-14FBD1212519
:END:

The final stage is the all important accounting stage, which calculates p&l.

**** Using the standard [[../systems/account.py][Account class]]

The standard accounting class includes several useful methods:

-  =portfolio=: works out the p&l for the whole system (returns
  accountCurve)
-  =pandl_for_instrument=: the contribution of a particular instrument
  to the p&l (returns accountCurve)
-  =pandl_for_subsystem=: work out how an instrument has done in
  isolation (returns accountCurve)
-  =pandl_across_subsystems=: group together all subsystem p&l (not the
  same as portfolio! Instrument weights aren't used) (returns
  accountCurveGroup)
-  =pandl_for_trading_rule=: how a trading rule has done agggregated
  over all instruments (returns accountCurveGroup)
-  =pandl_for_trading_rule_weighted=: how a trading rule has done over
  all instruments as a proportion of total capital (returns
  accountCurveGroup)
-  =pandl_for_trading_rule_unweighted=: how a trading rule has done over
  all instruments, unweighted (returns accountCurveGroup)
-  =pandl_for_all_trading_rules=: how all trading rules have done over
  all instruments (returns nested accountCurveGroup)
-  =pandl_for_all_trading_rules_unweighted=: how all trading rules have
  done over all instruments, unweighted (returns nested
  accountCurveGroup)
-  =pandl_for_instrument_rules=: how all trading rules have done for a
  particular instrument (returns accountCurveGroup)
-  =pandl_for_instrument_rules_unweighted=: how all trading rules have
  done for one instrument, unweighted (returns accountCurveGroup)
-  =pandl_for_instrument_forecast=: work out how well a particular
  trading rule variation has done with a particular instrument (returns
  accountCurve)
-  =pandl_for_instrument_forecast_weighted=: work out how well a
  particular trading rule variation has done with a particular
  instrument as a proportion of total capital (returns accountCurve)

(Note that [[#buffer][buffered]] positions are only used at the final
portfolio stage; the positions for forecasts and subsystems are not
buffered. So their trading costs may be a little overstated).

(Warning: see [[#weighted_acg][weighted and unweighted account curve groups]] )

These classes share some useful arguments (all boolean):

-  =delayfill=: Assume we trade at the next days closing price. Always
  defaults to True (more conservative)
-  =roundpositions=: Round positions to nearest instrument block.
  Defaults to True for portfolios and instruments, defaults to False
  for subsystems. Not used in =pandl_for_instrument_forecast= or
  =pandl_for_trading_rule= (always False)

All p&l methods return an object of type =accountCurve= (for instruments,
subsystems and instrument forecasts) or =accountCurveGroup= (for portfolio and
trading rule), or even nested =accountCurveGroup= (=pandl_for_all_trading_rules=,
=pandl_for_all_trading_rules_unweighted=). This inherits from a pandas data frame,
so it can be plotted, averaged and so on. It also has some special methods. To
see what they are use the =stats= method:

#+BEGIN_SRC python :session :results output
from systems.provided.futures_chapter15.basesystem import futures_system
system=futures_system()
system.accounts.portfolio().stats() 
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
[[('min', '-1.997e+05'),
  ('max', '4.083e+04'),
  ('median', '-1.631'),
  ('mean', '156.9'),
  ('std', '5226'),
  ('skew', '-7.054'),
  ('ann_mean', '4.016e+04'),
  ('ann_std', '8.361e+04'),
  ('sharpe', '0.4803'),
  ('sortino', '0.5193'),
  ('avg_drawdown', '-1.017e+05'),
  ('time_in_drawdown', '0.9621'),
  ('calmar', '0.1199'),
  ('avg_return_to_drawdown', '0.395'),
  ('avg_loss', '-3016'),
  ('avg_gain', '3371'),
  ('gaintolossratio', '1.118'),
  ('profitfactor', '1.103'),
  ('hitrate', '0.4968'),
  ('t_stat', '2.852'),
  ('p_value', '0.004349')],
 ('You can also plot / print:',
  ['rolling_ann_std', 'drawdown', 'curve', 'as_percent', 'as_cumulative'])]
#+END_EXAMPLE

The =stats= method lists three kinds of output:

1. Statistics which can also be extracted with their own methods eg to
   extract sortino use =system.accounts.portfolio().sortino()=
2. Methods which can be used to do interesting plots eg
   =system.accounts.portfolio().drawdown()=
3. Attributes which can be used to get returns over different periods,
   eg =systems.accounts.portfolio().annual=

**** =accountCurve=

There is a lot more to =accountCurve= and group objects than meets the eye.

Let's start with =accountCurve=, which is the output you get from
=systems.account.pandl_for_subsystem= amongst other things

#+BEGIN_SRC python :session :results output
acc_curve=system.accounts.pandl_for_subsystem("EDOLLAR", percentage=True)
#+END_SRC

This /looks/ like a pandas data frame, where each day is a different return.
However it's actually a bit more interesting than that. There's actually three
different account curves buried inside this; /gross/ p&l without costs, /costs/, and
/net/ including costs. We can access any of them like so:

#+BEGIN_SRC python :session :results output
acc_curve.gross 
acc_curve.net
acc_curve.costs
acc_curve.to_ncg_frame() ## this method returns a data frame with all 3 elements as columns
#+END_SRC

The /net/ version is identical to acc_curve; this is deliberate to encourage you
to look at net returns. Each curve defaults to displaying daily returns, however
we can also access different frequencies (daily, weekly, monthly, annual):

#+BEGIN_SRC python :session :results output
acc_curve.gross.daily ## equivalent to acc_curve.gross
acc_curve.net.daily ## equivalent to acc_curve and acc_curve.net
acc_curve.net.weekly ## or also acc_curve.weekly
acc_curve.costs.monthly
#+END_SRC

Once you have the frequency you require you can then use any of the statistical
methods:

#+BEGIN_SRC python :session :results output
acc_curve.gross.daily.stats() ## Get a list of methods. equivalent to acc_curve.gross.stats()
acc_curve.monthly.sharpe() ## Sharpe ratio based on annual 
acc_curve.gross.weekly.std() ## standard deviation of weekly returns
acc_curve.daily.ann_std() ## annualised std. deviation of daily (net) returns
acc_curve.costs.annual.median() ## median of annual costs
#+END_SRC

... or other interesting methods:

#+BEGIN_SRC python :session :results output
acc_curve.rolling_ann_std() ## rolling annual standard deviation of daily (net) returns
acc_curve.gross.curve() ## cumulated returns = account curve of gross daily returns
acc_curve.net.monthly.drawdown() ## drawdown of monthly net returns
acc_curve.costs.weekly.curve() ## cumulated weekly costs
#+END_SRC

You probably won't need it but acc_curve.calc_data() returns a dict of all the
information used to calculate a particular account curve. For example:

#+BEGIN_SRC python :session :results output
acc_curve.calc_data()['trades'] ## simulated trades
#+END_SRC

Personally I prefer looking at statistics in percentage terms. This is easy.
Just use the .percent() method before you use any statistical method:

#+BEGIN_SRC python :session :results output
acc_curve.capital ## tells me the capital I will use to calculate %
acc_curve.percent()
acc_curve.gross.daily.percent()
acc_curve.net.daily.percent() 
acc_curve.costs.monthly.percent()
acc_curve.gross.daily.percent().stats() 
acc_curve.monthly.percent().sharpe() 
acc_curve.gross.weekly.percent().std() 
acc_curve.daily.percent().ann_std() 
acc_curve.costs.annual.percent().median() 
acc_curve.percent().rolling_ann_std() 
acc_curve.gross.percent().curve() 
acc_curve.net.monthly.percent().drawdown() 
acc_curve.costs.weekly.percent().curve() 
#+END_SRC

You may also want to use /cumulated/ returns, which use compound interest rather
than the simple addition I normally use. See this [[http://qoppac.blogspot.co.uk/2016/06/capital-correction-pysystemtrade.html][blog post]].

#+BEGIN_SRC python :session :results output
acc_curve.cumulative()
acc_curve.gross.daily.cumulative() 
acc_curve.net.daily.cumulative() 
acc_curve.costs.monthly.cumulative()
acc_curve.gross.daily.cumulative().stats() 
acc_curve.monthly.cumulative().sharpe() 
acc_curve.gross.weekly.cumulative().std() 
acc_curve.daily.cumulative().ann_std() 
acc_curve.costs.annual.cumulative().median() 
acc_curve.cumulative().rolling_ann_std() 
acc_curve.gross.cumulative().curve() 
acc_curve.net.monthly.cumulative().drawdown() 
acc_curve.costs.weekly.cumulative().curve() 
#+END_SRC

Or both

#+BEGIN_SRC python :session :results output
acc_curve.cumulative().percent().stats()
acc_curve.percent().cumulative().stats() ## these are equivalent
#+END_SRC

**** =accountCurveGroup= in more detail

=accountCurveGroup=, is the output you get from =systems.account.portfolio=,
=systems.account.pandl_across_subsystems=, =pandl_for_instrument_rules_unweighted=,
=pandl_for_trading_rule= and =pandl_for_trading_rule_unweighted=.

For example:

#+BEGIN_SRC python :session :results output
acc_curve_group=system.accounts.portfolio(percentage=True)
#+END_SRC

Again this /looks/ like a pandas data frame, or indeed like an ordinary account
curve object. So for example these all work:

#+BEGIN_SRC python :session :results output
acc_curve_group.gross.daily.stats() ## Get a list of methods. equivalent to acc_curve.gross.stats()
acc_curve_group.monthly.sharpe() ## Sharpe ratio based on annual 
acc_curve_group.gross.weekly.std() ## standard deviation of weekly returns
acc_curve_group.daily.ann_std() ## annualised std. deviation of daily (net) returns
acc_curve_group.costs.annual.median() ## median of annual costs
#+END_SRC

These are in fact all giving the p&l for the entire portfolio (the sum of
individual account curves across all assets); defaulting to giving the net,
daily curve. To find out which assets we use acc_curve_group.asset_columns; to
access a particular asset we use acc_curve_group['assetName'].

#+BEGIN_SRC python :session :results output
acc_curve_group.asset_columns
acc_curve_group['US10']
#+END_SRC

/Warning see [[#weighted_acg][weighted and unweighted account curve groups]]/

The second command returns the account curves /just/ for US 10 year bonds. So we
can do things like:

#+BEGIN_SRC python :session :results output
acc_curve_group['US10'].gross.daily.stats() ## Get a list of methods. equivalent to acc_curve.gross.stats()
acc_curve_group['US10'].monthly.sharpe() ## Sharpe ratio based on annual 
acc_curve_group['US10'].gross.weekly.std() ## standard deviation of weekly returns
acc_curve_group['US10'].daily.ann_std() ## annualised std. deviation of daily (net) returns
acc_curve_group['US10'].costs.annual.median() ## median of annual costs
acc_curve_group['US10'].calc_data()['trades'] ## list of trades

acc_curve_group.gross['US10'].weekly.std() ## notice equivalent way of getting account curves
#+END_SRC

Sometimes it's nicer to plot all the individual account curves, so we can get a
data frame.

#+BEGIN_SRC python :session :results output
acc_curve_group.to_frame() ## returns net account curves all assets in a frame
acc_curve_group.net.to_frame() ## returns net account curves all assets in a frame
acc_curve_group.gross.to_frame() ## returns net account curves all assets in a frame
acc_curve_group.costs.to_frame() ## returns net account curves all assets in a frame
#+END_SRC

/Warning see [[#weighted_acg][weighted and unweighted account curve groups]]/

The other thing you can do is get a dictionary of any statistical method,
measured across all assets:

#+BEGIN_SRC python :session :results output
acc_curve_group.get_stats("sharpe", "net", "daily") ## get all annualised sharpe ratios using daily data
acc_curve_group.get_stats("sharpe", freq="daily") ## equivalent
acc_curve_group.get_stats("sharpe", curve_type="net") ## equivalent
acc_curve_group.net.get_stats("sharpe", freq="daily") ## equivalent
acc_curve_group.net.get_stats("sharpe", percent=False) ## defaults to giving stats in % terms, this turns it off
#+END_SRC

*Warning see [[#weighted_acg][weighted and unweighted account curve groups]]

You can get summary statistics for these. These can either be simple averages
across all assets, or time weighted by the amount of data each asset has.

#+BEGIN_SRC python :session :results output
acc_curve_group.get_stats("sharpe").mean() ## get simple average of annualised sharpe ratios for net returns using daily data
acc_curve_group.get_stats("sharpe").std(time_weighted=True) ## get time weighted standard deviation of sharpes across assets,  
acc_curve_group.get_stats("sharpe").tstat(time_weighted=False) ## t tstatistic for average sharpe ratio
acc_curve_group.get_stats("sharpe").pvalue(time_weighted=True) ## p value of t statistic of time weighted average sharpe ratio.
#+END_SRC

Sometimes it's useful to "stack" all the returns from different assets together,
and perform statistical tests on those:

#+BEGIN_SRC python :session :results output
stack=acc_curve_group.stack() ## looks like a very long history of returns for a single asset
stack.net.weekly.sharpe() ## all this kind of stuff works
boot=stack.bootstrap(no_runs=10) ## produce an accountCurveGroup object containing 10 bootstraps, each the same length as the original portfolio
boot=stack.bootstrap(no_runs=10, length=250)  ## each account curve bootstrapped will be 250 business days long
boot.net.get_stats("sharpe").pvalue() ## all this kind of stuff works. Time weighting isn't neccessary as all the same length
#+END_SRC

Note if you have a large number of instruments this code will probably
fail. It's more useful when you have a small number, and are concerned
about statistical robustness.

**** A nested =accountCurveGroup=

A nested =accountCurveGroup=, is the output you get from
=pandl_for_all_trading_rules= and =pandl_for_all_trading_rules_unweighted=. For
example:

#+BEGIN_SRC python :session :results output
nested_acc_curve_group=system.accounts.pandl_for_all_trading_rules()
#+END_SRC

This is an account curve group, whose elements are the performance of each
trading rule eg this kind of thing works:

#+BEGIN_SRC python :session :results output
ewmac64_acc=system.accounts.pandl_for_all_trading_rules()['ewmac64_256']
#+END_SRC

However this is also an accountCurveGroup! So you can, for example display how
each instrument within this trading rule contributed to performance as a data
frame:

#+BEGIN_SRC python :session :results output
ewmac64_acc.to_frame()
#+END_SRC

***** Weighted and unweighted account curve groups

There are two types of account curve; weighted and unweighted. Weighted curves
include returns for each instrument (or trading rule) as a proportion of the
total capital at risk. Unweighted curves show each instrument or trading rule in
isolation.

Weighted: - =portfolio=: works out the p&l for the whole system
(weighted group - elements are =pandl_for_instrument= - effective
weights are instrument weights * IDM) - =pandl_for_instrument=: the
contribution of a particular instrument to the p&l (weighted individual
curve for one instrument - effective weight is instrument weight * IDM)
- =pandl_for_instrument_rules=: how all trading rules have done for a
particular instrument (weighted group - elements are
=pandl_for_instrument_forecast= across trading rules; effective weights
are forecast weights * FDM)
- =pandl_for_instrument_forecast_weighted=: work out how well a
particular trading rule variation has done with a particular instrument
as a proportion of total capital (weighted individual curve - weights
are forecast weight * FDM * instrument weight * IDM) -
=pandl_for_trading_rule_weighted=: how a trading rule has done over all
instruments as a proportion of total capital (weighted group - elements
are =pandl_for_instrument_forecast_weighted= across instruments -
effective weights are risk contribution of instrument to trading rule) -
=pandl_for_all_trading_rules=: how all trading rules have done over all
instruments (weighted group -elements are
=pandl_for_trading_rule_weighted= across variations - effective weight
is risk contribution of each trading rule)

Partially weighted (see below): - =pandl_for_trading_rule=: how a
trading rule has done over all instruments (weighted group -elements are
=pandl_for_instrument_forecast_weighted= across instruments, weights are
risk contribution of each instrument to trading rule)

Unweighted: - =pandl_across_subsystems=: works out the p&l for all
subsystems (unweighted group - elements are =pandl_for_subsystem=) -
=pandl_for_subsystem=: work out how an instrument has done in isolation
(unweighted individual curve for one instrument) -
=pandl_for_instrument_forecast=: work out how well a particular trading
rule variation has done with a particular instrument (unweighted
individual curve) - =pandl_for_instrument_rules_unweighted=: how all
trading rules have done for a particular instrument (unweighted group -
elements are =pandl_for_instrument_forecast= across trading rules) -
=pandl_for_trading_rule_unweighted=: how a trading rule has done over
all instruments (unweighted group -elements are
=pandl_for_instrument_forecast= across instruments) -
=pandl_for_all_trading_rules_unweighted=: how all trading rules have
done over all instruments (unweighted group -elements are
=pandl_for_trading_rule= across instruments - effective weight is risk
contribution of each trading rule)

Note that =pandl_across_subsystems= / =pandl_for_subsystem= are
effectively the unweighted versions of =portfolio= /
=pandl_for_instrument=.

The difference is important for a few reasons.

-  Firstly the return and risk of individual weighted curves will be
  lower than the target
-  The returns of individual weighted curves will also be highly non
  stationary, at least for instruments. This is because the weightings
  of instruments within a portfolio, or a trading rule, will change
  over time. Usually there are fewer instruments. This means that the
  risk profile will show much higher returns earlier in the series.
  Statistics such as sharpe ratio may be highly misleading.
-  The portfolio level aggregate returns of unweighted group curves will
  make no sense. They will be equally weighted, whereas we'd normally
  have different weights.
-  Also for portfolios of unweighted groups risk will usually fall over
  time as markets are added and diversification effects appear. Again
  this is more problematic for groups of instruments (within a
  portfolio, or within a trading rule)

Weighting for trading rules p&l is a /little/ complicated.

=pandl_for_instrument_forecast=: If I want the p&l of a single trading
rule for one instrument in isolation, then I use
=pandl_for_instrument_forecast=. =pandl_for_trading_rule_unweighted=:
If I aggregate these across instruments then I get
=pandl_for_trading_rule_unweighted=. The individiual unweighted curves
are instrument p&l for each instrument and forecast.

=pandl_for_instrument_forecast_weighted= The weighted p&l of a single
trading rule for one instrument, as a proportion of the /entire system's
capital/, will be it's individual p&l in isolation
(=pandl_for_instrument_forecast=) multiplied by the product of the
instrument and forecast weights, and the IDM and FDM (this ignores the
effect of total forecast capping and position buffering or inertia).

=pandl_for_trading_rule_weighted=: The weighted p&l of a single
trading rule across individual instruments, as a proportion of the
/entire system's capital/, will be the group of
=pandl_for_instrument_forecast_weighted= of these for a given rule. You
can get this with =pandl_for_trading_rule_weighted=. The individual
curves within this will be instrument p&l for the relevant trading rule,
effectively weighted by the product of instrument, forecast weights, FDM
and IDM. The risk of the total curve will be equal to the risk of the
rule as part of the total capital, so will be lower than you'd expect.

=pandl_for_all_trading_rules= If I group the resulting curves across
trading rules, then I get =pandl_for_all_trading_rules=. The individual
curves will be individual trading rules, weighted by their contribution
to total risk. The total curve is the entire system; it will look close
to but not exactly like a =portfolio= account curve because of the non
linear effects of combined forecast capping, and position buffering or
inertia, and rounding if that's used for the portfolio curve.

=pandl_for_trading_rule=: If I want the performance of a given trading rule across
individual instruments in isolation, then I need to take
=pandl_for_trading_rule_weighted= and normalise it so that the returns are as a
proportion of the sum of all the relevant forecast weight * FDM * instrument
weight * IDM; this is equivalent to the rules risk contribution within the
system. . This is an unweighted curve in one sense (it's not a proportion of
total capital), but it's weighted in another (the indiviaul curves when added up
give the group curve). The total account curve will have the same target risk as
the entire system. The individual curves within it are for each instrument,
weighted by their contribution to risk.

/=pandl_for_all_trading_rules_unweighted=:/ If I group /these/ curves together,
then I get =pandl_for_all_trading_rules_unweighted=. The individual curves will
be individual trading rules but not weighted; so each will have its own risk
target. This is an unweighted group in the truest sense; the total curve won't
make sense.

To summarise:

-  Individual account curves either in, or outside, a weighted group
  should be treated with caution. But the entire portfolio curve is fine.
-  The portfolio level account curve for an unweighted group should be
  treated with caution. But the individual curves are fine.
-  With the exception of =pandl_for_trading_rule= the portfolio level
  curve for a weighted group is a proportion of the entire system capital.

The attribute =weighted_flag= is set to either True (for weighted curves
including =pandl_for_trading_rule=) or False (otherwise). All curve *repr*
methods also show either weighted or unweighted status.

**** Testing account curves

If you want to know how significant the returns for an account curve are (no
matter where you got it from), then use the method =accurve.t_test()=. This
returns the two sided t-test statistic and p-value for a null hypothesis of a
zero mean.

Sometimes you might want to compare the performance of two systems, instruments
or trading rules. The function =from syscore.accounting import account_test= can
be used for this purpose. The two parameters can be anything that looks like an
account curve, no matter where you got it from.

When run it returns a two sided t-test statistic and p-value for the null
hypothesis of identical means. This is done on the period of time that both
objects are trading.

Warning: The assumptions underlying a t-test may be violated for financial data.
Use with care.

#### Costs

I work out costs in two different ways:

-  by applying a constant drag calculated according to the standardised
  cost in Sharpe ratio terms and the estimated turnover (see chapter 12 of my
  book)
-  using the actual costs for each trade.

The former method is always used for costs derived from forecasts
(=pandl_for_instrument_forecast=, =pandl_for_instrument_forecast_weighted=,
=pandl_for_trading_rule=, =pandl_for_all_trading_rules=,
=pandl_for_all_trading_rules_unweighted=, =pandl_for_trading_rule_unweighted=,
=pandl_for_trading_rule_weighted=, =pandl_for_instrument_rules_unweighted=, and
=pandl_for_instrument_rules=).

The latter method is optional for costs derived from actual positions
(everything else). Set =config.use_SR_costs = False= to use it for these
methods. It is useful for comparing with live trading history, but I do not
recommend it for historical purposes as I don't think it is accurate in the
past.

Costs that can be included are:

-  Slippage, in price points. Half the bid-ask spread, unless trading in
  large size or with a long history of trading at a better cost.
-  Cost per instrument block, in local currency. This is used for most
  futures.
-  Percentage of value costs (0.01 is 1%). Used for US equities.
-  Per trade costs, in local currency. Common for UK brokers. This won't
  be applied correctly unless =roundpositions=True= in the accounts call.

To see the turnover that has been estimated use:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    system.accounts.subsystem_turnover(instrument_code) ### Annualised turnover
    of subsystem system.accounts.instrument_turnover(instrument_code) ###
    Annualised turnover of portfolio level position
    system.accounts.forecast_turnover(instrument_code, rule_variation_name) ##
    Annualised turnover of forecast
#+END_EXAMPLE

For calculating forecast costs (=pandl_for_instrument_forecast=... and so on.
Note these are used for estimating forecast weights) I offer the option to pool
costs across instruments. You can either pool the estimate of turnovers (which I
recommend), or pool the average of cost * turnover (which I don't recommend).
Averaging in the pooling process is always done with more weight given to

**** Writing new or modified accounting stages

I plan to include ways of summarising profits over groups of assets (trading
rules and instruments) in the account stage.

This section gives much more detail on certain important processes that span
multiple stages: logging, estimating correlations and diversification
multipliers, optimisation, and capital correction.

## Logging

*** Basic logging

The system, data, config and each stage object all have a .log attribute, to
allow the system to report to the user; as do the functions provided to estimate
correlations and do optimisations.

In the current version this just prints to screen, although in future logging
will be able to write to databases and files, and send emails if critical events
are happening.

The pre-baked systems I've included all include a parameter log_level. This can
be one of the following:

-  Off: No logging, except for warnings and errors
-  Terse: Print
-  On: Print everything.

Alternatively you can set this yourself:

#+BEGIN_SRC python :session :results output
system.set_logging_level(log_level)
#+END_SRC

If you're writing your own code, and want to inform the user that something is
happening you should do one of the following:

#+BEGIN_SRC python :session :results output
## self could be a system, stage, config or data object
#
self.log.msg("this is a normal message, will only be printed if logging is
On") self.log.terse("this message will only be printed if logging is Terse
or On") self.log.warn("this message will always be printed")
self.log.error("this message will always be printed, and an exception will
be raised")
#+END_SRC

I strongly encourage the use of logging, rather than printing, since printing on
a 'headless' automated trading server will not be visible. As you can see the
log is also currently used for very basic error handling.

*** Advanced logging

In my experience wading through long log files is a rather time consuming
experience. On the other hand it's often more useful to use a logging approach
to monitor system behaviour than to try and create quantitative diagnostics. For
this reason I'm a big fan of logging with /attributes/. Every time a log method
is called, it will typically know one or more of the following:

-  which 'type' of process owns the logger. For example if it's part of
  a base_system object, its type will be 'base_system'. Future types will
  probably include price collection, execution and so on.
-  which 'stage' or sub process is involved, such as 'rawdata'.
-  which instrument code is involved
-  which trading rule variation is involved
-  which specific futures contract we're looking at (for the future)
-  which order id (for the future)

Then we'll be able to save the log message with its attributes in a database (in
future). We can then query the database to get, for example, all the log
activity relating to a particular instrument code or trade, for particular
dates.

You do need to keep track of what attributes your logger has. Generally speaking
you should use this kind of pattern to write a log item

#+BEGIN_SRC python :session :results output
# this is from the ForecastScaleCapFixed code
#
# This log will already have type=base_system, and stage=forecastScaleCap
#
this_stage.log.msg("Calculating scaled forecast for %s %s" %
                   (instrument_code, rule_variation_name),
                   instrument_code=instrument_code,
                   rule_variation_name=rule_variation_name)
#+END_SRC

This has the advantage of keeping the original log attributes intact. If you
want to do something more complex it's worth looking at the doc string for the
logger class [[/syslogdiag/log.py][here]] which shows how attributes are
inherited and added to log instances.

## Optimisation

See my blog posts on optimisation:
[[http://qoppac.blogspot.co.uk/2016/01/correlations-weights-multipliers.html][without]]
and
[[http://qoppac.blogspot.co.uk/2016/05/optimising-weights-with-costs.html][with
costs]].

I use an optimiser to calculate both forecast and instrument weights. The
process is almost identical for both.

*** The optimisation function, and data

From the config

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
forecast_weight_estimate: ## can also be applied to instrument weights func:
syscore.optimisation.GenericOptimiser ## this is the only function
provided pool_instruments: True ## not used for instrument weights
frequency: "W" ## other options: D, M, Y
#+END_EXAMPLE

I recommend using weekly data, since it speeds things up and doesn't affect out
of sample performance.

*** Removing expensive assets (forecast weights only)

Again I recommend you check out this
[[http://qoppac.blogspot.co.uk/2016/05/optimising-weights-with-costs.html][blog
post]].

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
forecast_weight_estimate: ceiling_cost_SR: 0.13 ## Max cost to allow for
assets, annual SR units.
#+END_EXAMPLE

See [[#costs]['costs']] to see how to configure pooling when estimating the
costs of forecasts.

*** Pooling gross returns (forecast weights only)

Pooling across instruments is only available when calculating forecast weights.
Again I recommend you check out this
[[http://qoppac.blogspot.co.uk/2016/05/optimising-weights-with-costs.html][blog
post]]. Only instruments whose rules have survived the application of a ceiling
cost will be included in the pooling process.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    forecast_weight_estimate: pool_gross_returns: True ## pool gross returns for
       estimation forecast_cost_estimate: use_pooled_costs: False ### use
       weighted average of [SR cost * turnover] across instruments with the same
       set of trading rules use_pooled_turnover: True ### Use weighted average
       of turnover across instruments with the same set of trading rules

#+END_EXAMPLE

See [[#costs]['costs']] to see how to configure pooling when estimating the
costs of forecasts. Notice if pool_gross_returns is True, and
use_pooled_costs is True, then a single optimisation will be run across all
instruments with a common set of trading rules. Otherwise each instrument is
optimised individually, which is slower.

*** Working out net costs (both instrument and forecast weights)

Again I recommend you check out this
[[http://qoppac.blogspot.co.uk/2016/05/optimising-weights-with-costs.html][blog
post]].

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
forecast_weight_estimate: ## can also be applied to instrument weights
equalise_gross: False ## equalise gross returns so that only costs are
used for optimisation cost_multiplier: 0.0 ## multiply costs by this
number. Zero means grosss returns used. Higher than 1 means costs will be
inflated. Use zero if apply_cost_weight=True (see later)
#+END_EXAMPLE

Notice if equalise_gross is True, and use_pooled_costs is True, then a single
optimisation will be run across all instruments with a common set of trading
rules (regardless of the value of pool_gross_returns).

*** Time periods

There are three options available for the fitting period - expanding
(recommended), in sample (never!) and rolling. See Chapter 3 of my book.

From the config

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
       date_method: expanding ## other options: in_sample, rolling rollyears: 20
#+END_EXAMPLE

*** Moment estimation

To do an optimisation we need estimates of correlations, means, and standard
deviations.

From the config

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
forecast_weight_estimate: ## can also be applied to instrument weights
correlation_estimate: func:
syscore.correlations.correlation_single_period using_exponent: False
ew_lookback: 500 min_periods: 20 floor_at_zero: True

mean_estimate: func: syscore.algos.mean_estimator using_exponent: False
ew_lookback: 500 min_periods: 20

vol_estimate: func: syscore.algos.vol_estimator using_exponent: False
ew_lookback: 500 min_periods: 20
#+END_EXAMPLE

If you're using shrinkage or single period optimisation I'd suggest using an
exponential weight for correlations, means, and volatility.

*** Methods

There are four methods provided to optimise with in the function I've included.
Personally I'd use shrinkage if I wanted a quick answer, then bootstrapping.

**** Equal weights

This will give everything in the optimisation equal weights.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
method: equal_weights
#+END_EXAMPLE

This differs from the "fixed" flavour of forecast combination which gives equal
weight to all trading rules; because here any trading rules that are too
expensive for a particular instrument will not be included, and effectively have
a zero weight.

**** One period (not recommend)

This is the classic Markowitz optimisation with the option to equalise Sharpe
Ratios (makes things more stable) and volatilities. Since we're dealing with
things that should have the same volatility anyway the latter is something I
recommend doing.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
method: one_period equalise_SR: True ann_target_SR: 0.5 ## Sharpe we head
to if we're equalising equalise_vols: True
#+END_EXAMPLE

Notice that if you equalise Sharpe then this will override the effect of any
pooling or changes to cost calculation.

**** Bootstrapping (recommended, but slow)

Here we're bootstrapping, by default drawing 50 weeks of data at a time, 100
times.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
method: bootstrap monte_runs: 100 bootstrap_length: 50 equalise_SR: False
ann_target_SR: 0.5 ## Sharpe we head to if we're shrinking or equalising
equalise_vols: True
#+END_EXAMPLE

Notice that if you equalise Sharpe then this will override the effect of any
pooling or changes to cost calculation.

**** Shrinkage

This is a basic shrinkage towards a prior of equal sharpe ratios, and equal
correlations; with priors equal to the average of estimates from the data.
Shrinkage of 1.0 means we use the priors, 0.0 means we use the empirical
estimates.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
       method: shrinkage shrinkage_SR: 0.90 ann_target_SR: 0.5 ## Sharpe we head
       to if we're shrinking shrinkage_corr: 0.50 equalise_vols: True
#+END_EXAMPLE

Notice that if you equalise Sharpe by shrinking with a factor of 1.0, then this
will override the effect of any pooling or changes to cost calculation.

*** Post processing

If we haven't accounted for costs earlier (eg by setting =cost_multiplier=0=)
then we can adjust our portfolio weights according to costs after they've been
calculated. See this blog post
[[http://qoppac.blogspot.co.uk/2016/05/optimising-weights-with-costs.html][blog
post]].

If weights are /cleaned/, then in a fitting period when we need a weight, but
none has been calculated (due to insufficient data for example), an instrument
is given a share of the weight.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
       apply_cost_weight: True cleaning: True
#+END_EXAMPLE

 ## Estimating correlations and diversification multipliers

See
[[http://qoppac.blogspot.co.uk/2016/01/correlations-weights-multipliers.html][my
blog post]]

You can estimate diversification multipliers for both instruments (IDM - see
chapter 11) and forecasts (FDM - see chapter 8).

The first step is to estimate /correlations/. The process is the same, except
that for forecasts you have the option to pool instruments together. As the
following YAML extract shows I recommend estimating these with an exponential
moving average on weekly data:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    forecast_correlation_estimate: pool_instruments: True ## not available for
       IDM estimation func: syscore.correlations.CorrelationEstimator ##
       function to use for estimation. This handles both pooled and non pooled
       data frequency: "W" # frequency to downsample to before estimating
       correlations date_method: "expanding" # what kind of window to use in
       backtest using_exponent: True # use an exponentially weighted
       correlation, or all the values equally ew_lookback: 250 ## lookback when
       using exponential weighting min_periods: 20 # min_periods, used for both
       exponential, and non exponential weighting cleaning: True # Replace
       missing values with an average so we don't lose data early on
#+END_EXAMPLE

Once we have correlations, and the forecast or instrument weights, it's a
trivial calculation.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    instrument_div_mult_estimate: func:
       syscore.divmultipliers.diversification_multiplier_from_list ## function
       to use ewma_span: 125 ## smooth to apply floor_at_zero: True ## floor
       negative correlations div_mult: 2.5 ## maximum allowable multiplier
#+END_EXAMPLE

I've included a smoothing function, other wise jumps in the multiplier will
cause trading in the backtest. Note that the FDM is calculated on an instrument
by instrument basis, but if instruments have had their forecast weights and
correlations estimated on a pooled basis they'll have the same FDM. It's also a
good idea to floor negative correlations at zero to avoid inflation the DM to
very high values.

## Capital correction: Varying capital

Capital correction is the process by which we change the capital we have at
risk, and thus our positions, according to any profits or losses made. Most of
pysystemtrade assumes that capital is /fixed/. This has the advantage that risk
is stable over time, and account curves can more easily be interpreted. However
a more common method is to use /compounded/ capital, where profits are added to
capital and losses deducted. If we make money then our capital, and the risk
we're taking, and the size of our positions, will all increase over time.

There is much more in this
[[http://qoppac.blogspot.co.uk/2016/06/capital-correction-pysystemtrade.html][blog
post]]. Capital correction is controlled by the following config parameter which
selects the function used for correction using the normal dot argument (the
default here being the function =fixed_capital= in the module =syscore.capital=)

YAML:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
capital_multiplier: func: syscore.capital.fixed_capital
#+END_EXAMPLE

Other functions I've written are =full_compounding= and =half_compounding=.
Again see the blog post
[[http://qoppac.blogspot.co.uk/2016/06/capital-correction-pysystemtrade.html][blog
post]] for more detail.

To get the varying capital multiplier which the chosen method calculates use
=system.accounts.capital_multiplier()=. The multiplier will be 1.0 at a given
time if the variable capital is identical to the fixed capital.

Here's a list of methods with their counterparts for both fixed and variable
capital:

|                                          | Fixed capital                                                            | Variable capital                                   |
|------------------------------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------+----------------------------------------------------|
| Get capital at risk                      | =positionSize.get_daily_cash_vol_target()['notional_trading_capital']=   | =accounts.get_actual_capital()=                    |
| Get position in a system portfolio       | =portfolio.get_notional_position=                                        | =portfolio.get_actual_position=                    |
| Get buffers for a position               | =portfolio.get_buffers_for_position=                                     | =portfolio.get_actual_buffers_for_position=        |
| Get buffered position                    | =accounts.get_buffered_position=                                         | =accounts.get_buffered_position_with_multiplier=   |
| Get p&l for instrument at system level   | =accounts.pandl_for_instrument=                                          | =accounts.pandl_for_instrument_with_multiplier=    |
| P&L for whole system                     | =accounts.portfolio=                                                     | =accounts.portfolio_with_multiplier=               |

All other methods in pysystemtrade use fixed capital.

:PROPERTIES:

:END:

The tables in this section list all the methods that can be used to get data out
of a system and its 'child' stages. You can also use the methods() method:

#+BEGIN_SRC python :session :results output
system.rawdata.methods() ## works for any stage or data
#+END_SRC

*** Explanation of columns

For brevity the name of the system instance is omitted from the 'call' column
(except where it's the actual system object we're calling directly). So for
example to get the instrument price for Eurodollar from the data object, which
is marked as /=data.get_raw_price=/ we would do something like this:

#+BEGIN_SRC python :session :results output
from systems.provided.futures_chapter15.basesystem import futures_system
name_of_system=futures_system() name_of_system.data.get_raw_price("EDOLLAR")
#+END_SRC

Standard methods are in all systems. Non standard methods are for stage classes
inherited from the standard class, eg the raw data method specific to /futures/;
or the /estimate/ classes which estimate parameters rather than use fixed
versions.

Common arguments are:

-  =instrument_code=: A string indicating the name of the instrument
-  =rule_variation_name=: A string indicating the name of the trading rule variation

Types are one or more of D, I, O:

-  *D*iagnostic: Exposed method useful for seeing intermediate
  calculations
-  Key *I*nput: A method which gets information from another stage. See
  [[#stage_wiring][stage wiring]]. The description will list the source of the
  data.
-  Key *O*utput: A method whose output is used by other stages. See
  [[#stage_wiring][stage wiring]]. Note this excludes items only used by
  specific trading rules (noteably rawdata.daily_annualised_roll)

Private methods are excluded from this table.

** Configuration options
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       80DED45B-8AD4-4D5F-AFA2-1543E62C31BD
:END:

Below is a list of all configuration options for the system. The 'Yaml' section
shows how they appear in a yaml file. The 'python' section shows an example of
how you'd modify a config object in memory having first created it, like this:

#+BEGIN_SRC python :session :results output
## Method one: from an existing system from
systems.provided.futures_chapter15.basesystem import futures_system
system=futures_system() new_config=system.config

## Method two: from a config file from syscore.fileutils import
get_pathname_for_package from sysdata.configdata import Config

my_config=Config(get_pathname_for_package("private", "this_system_name",
                                          "config.yaml"))

## Method three: with a blank config from sysdata.configdata import Config
my_config=Config()
#+END_SRC

Each section also shows the project default options, which you could change [[#defaults][here]].

When modifying a nested part of a config object, you can of course replace it
wholesale:

#+BEGIN_SRC python :session :results output
new_config.instrument_weights=dict(SP500=0.5, US10=0.5))
new_config
#+END_SRC

Or just in part:

#+BEGIN_SRC python :session :results output
new_config.instrument_weights['SP500']=0.2 new_config
#+END_SRC

If you do this make sure the rest of the config is consistent with what you've
done. In either case, it's a good idea to examine the modified config once it's
part of the system (since that will include any defaults) and make sure you're
happy with it.

*** Raw data stage

**** Volatility calculation

Represented as: dict of str, int, or float. Keywords: Parameter names Defaults:
As below

The function used to calculate volatility, and any keyword arguments passed to
it. Note if any keyword is missing then the project defaults will be used. See
[[#vol_calc]['volatility calculation']] for more information.

The following shows how to modify the configuration, and also the default
values:

YAML:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
volatility_calculation: func: "syscore.algos.robust_vol_calc" days: 35
  min_periods: 10 vol_abs_min: 0.0000000001 vol_floor: True floor_min_quant:
  0.05 floor_min_periods: 100 floor_days: 500
#+END_EXAMPLE

Python

#+BEGIN_SRC python :session :results output
config.volatility_calculation=dict(func="syscore.algos.robust.vol.calc",
                                   days=35, min_periods=10, vol_abs_min= 0.0000000001, vol_floor=True,
                                   floor_min_quant=0.05, floor_min_periods=100, floor_days=500)
#+END_SRC

If you're considering using your own function please see [[#config_function_defaults][configuring defaults for your own functions]]

*** Rules stage

**** Trading rules

Represented as: dict of dicts, each representing a trading rule. Keywords:
trading rule variation names. Defaults: n/a

The set of trading rules. A trading rule definition consists of a dict
containing: a /function/ identifying string, an optional list of /data/ identifying
strings, and /other_args/ an optional dictionary containing named paramters to be
passed to the function. This is the only method that can be used for YAML.

There are numerous other ways to define trading rules using python code. See
[[#rules]['Rules']] for more detail.

Note that /forecast_scalar/ isn't strictly part of the trading rule definition,
but if included here will be used instead of the seperate
'config.forecast_scalar' parameter (see the next section).

YAML: (example)

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
trading_rules: ewmac2_8: function: systems.futures.rules.ewmac data:
  - "rawdata.daily_prices"
  - "rawdata.daily_returns_volatility"
    other_args: Lfast: 2 Lslow: 8 forecast_scalar: 10.6
#+END_EXAMPLE

Python (example)

#+BEGIN_SRC python :session :results output
config.trading_rules=dict(ewmac2_8=dict(function="systems.futures.rules.ewmac",
                                        data=["rawdata.daily_prices", "rawdata.daily_returns_volatility"],
                                        other_args=dict(Lfast=2, Lslow=8), forecast_scalar=10.6))
#+END_SRC

*** Forecast scaling and capping stage

Switch between fixed (default) and estimated versions as follows:

YAML: (example)

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
use_forecast_scale_estimates: True
#+END_EXAMPLE

Python (example)

#+BEGIN_SRC python :session :results output
config.use_forecast_scale_estimates=True
#+END_SRC

**** Forecast scalar (fixed - using =class ForecastScaleCapFixed=)

Represented as: dict of floats. Keywords: trading rule variation names. Default:
1.0

The forecast scalar to apply to a trading rule, if fixed scaling is being used.
If undefined the default value of 1.0 will be used.

Scalars can also be put inside trading rule definitions (this is the first place
we look):

YAML: (example)

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
trading_rules: rule_name: function: systems.futures.rules.arbitrary_function
forecast_scalar: 10.6
#+END_EXAMPLE

Python (example)

#+BEGIN_SRC python :session :results output
config.trading_rules=dict(rule_name=dict(function="systems.futures.rules.arbitrary_function", forecast_scalar=10.6))
#+END_SRC

If scalars are not found there they can be put in seperately (if you do both
then the scalar in the actual rule specification will take precedence):

YAML: (example)

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
forecast_scalars: rule_name: 10.6
#+END_EXAMPLE

Python (example)

#+BEGIN_SRC python :session :results output
config.forecast_scalars=dict(rule_name=10.6)
#+END_SRC

**** Forecast scalar estimation (using =class ForecastScaleCapEstimated=)

Represented as: dict of str, float and int. Keywords: parameter names Default:
see below

The method used to estimate forecast scalars on a rolling out of sample basis.
Any missing config elements are pulled from the project defaults. Compulsory
arguments are pool_instruments (determines if we pool estimate over multiple
instruments) and func (str function pointer to use for estimation). The
remaining arguments are passed to the estimation function.

See [forecast scale estimation](#scalar_estimate] for more detail.

If you're considering using your own function please see
[[#config_function_defaults][configuring defaults for your own functions]]

YAML:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
# Here is how we do the estimation. These are also the *defaults*.
forecast_scalar_estimate: pool_instruments: True func:
   "syscore.algos.forecast_scalar" window: 250000 min_periods: 500 backfill:
   True

#+END_EXAMPLE

Python (example)

#+BEGIN_SRC python :session :results output
## pooled example config.trading_rules=dict(pool_instruments=True,
func="syscore.algos.forecast_scalar", window=250000, min_periods=500,
backfill=True)
#+END_SRC

**** Forecast cap (fixed - all classes)

Represented as: float

The forecast cap to apply to a trading rule. If undefined the project default
value of 20.0 will be used.

YAML:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
forecast_cap: 20.0
#+END_EXAMPLE

Python

#+BEGIN_SRC python :session :results output
config.forecast_cap=20.0
#+END_SRC

*** Forecast combination stage

Switch between fixed (default) and estimated versions as follows:

YAML: (example)

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
use_forecast_weight_estimates: True
#+END_EXAMPLE

Python (example)

#+BEGIN_SRC python :session :results output
config.use_forecast_weight_estimates=True
#+END_SRC

Change smoothing used for both fixed and variable weights:

YAML: (example)

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
forecast_weight_ewma_span: 125
#+END_EXAMPLE

**** Forecast weights (fixed using =ForecastCombinedFixed=)

Represented as: (a) dict of floats. Keywords: trading rule variation names. (b)
dict of dicts, each representing the weights for an instrument. Keywords:
instrument names Default: Equal weights, across all trading rules in the system

The forecast weights to be used to combine forecasts from different trading rule
variations. These can be (a) common across instruments, or (b) specified
differently for each instrument.

Notice that the default is equal weights, but these are calculated on the fly
and don't appear in the defaults file.

YAML: (a)

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
forecast_weights: ewmac: 0.50 carry: 0.50
#+END_EXAMPLE

Python (a)

#+BEGIN_SRC python :session :results output
config.forecast_weights=dict(ewmac=0.5, carry=0.5)
#+END_SRC

YAML: (b)

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
forecast_weights: SP500: ewmac: 0.50 carry: 0.50 US10: ewmac: 0.10 carry: 0.90
#+END_EXAMPLE

Python (b)

#+BEGIN_SRC python :session :results output
config.forecast_weights=dict(SP500=dict(ewmac=0.5, carry=0.5), US10=dict(ewmac=0.10, carry=0.90))
#+END_SRC

**** Forecast weights (estimated using =ForecastCombinedFixed=)

To estimate forecast weights we need to define which trading rule variations
we're using.

***** List of trading rules to get forecasts for

Represented as: (a) list of str, each a rule variation name (b) dict of list of
str, each representing the rules for an instrument. Keywords: instrument names
Default: Using all trading rules in the system

The rules for which forecast weights are to be calculated. These can be (a)
common across instruments, or (b) specified differently for each instrument. If
not specified will use all the rules defined in the system.

YAML: (a)

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
rule_variations:
     - "ewmac"
     - "carry"
#+END_EXAMPLE

Python (a)

#+BEGIN_SRC python :session :results output
config.rule_variations=["ewmac", "carry"]
#+END_SRC

YAML: (b)

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
rule_variations: SP500:
      - "ewmac"
      - "carry"
     US10:
      - "ewmac"
#+END_EXAMPLE

Python (b)

#+BEGIN_SRC python :session :results output
config.forecast_weights=dict(SP500=["ewmac","carry"], US10=["ewmac"])
#+END_SRC

***** Parameters for estimating forecast weights

Represented as: dict of str, or dict, each representing parameters. Defaults:
See below

To estimate the forecast weights we call the function defined in the =func=
config element.

The defaults given below are for the default generic optimiser function. See the
section on (optimisation)[#optimisation] for more information.

YAML, showing defaults

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
forecast_weight_estimate: func: syscore.optimisation.GenericOptimiser

config.forecast_weight_estimate=dict()
config.forecast_weight_estimate['method']='one_period'
config.forecast_weight_estimate['mean_estimate']=dict(min_periods=30)
#+END_SRC

Note: if you are changing the config in situ within the system you should use
the following to avoid overwriting the defaults within the system:

#+BEGIN_SRC python :session :results output
config=system.config config.forecast_weight_estimate['method']='one_period'
config.forecast_weight_estimate['mean_estimate']['min_periods']=30
#+END_SRC

**** Forecast diversification multiplier (fixed using =ForecastCombinedFixed=)

Represented as: (a) float or (b) dict of floats with keywords: instrument_codes
Default: 1.0

This can be (a) common across instruments, or (b) we use a different one for
each instrument (would be normal if instrument weights were also different).

YAML: (a)

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
forecast_div_multiplier: 1.0
#+END_EXAMPLE

Python (a)

#+BEGIN_SRC python :session :results output
config.forecast_div_multiplier=1.0
#+END_SRC

**** Buffering

Represented as: bool Default: see below

Which [[#buffer][buffering or position inertia method]] should we use?
'position': based on optimal position (position inertia), 'forecast': based on
position with a forecast of +10; or 'none': do not use a buffer. What size
should the buffer be, as a proportion of the position or average forecast
position? 0.1 is 10%.

YAML:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
buffer_method: position buffer_size: 0.10
#+END_EXAMPLE

*** Accounting stage

**** Buffering and position intertia

To work out the portfolio positions should we trade to the edge of the
[[#buffer][buffer]], or to the optimal position?

Represented as: bool Default: True

YAML:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
buffer_trade_to_edge: True
#+END_EXAMPLE

**** Costs

Should we use normalised Sharpe Ratio [[#costs][costs]], or the actual costs for
instrument level p&l (we always use SR costs for forecasts)?

YAML:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
use_SR_costs: True
#+END_EXAMPLE

Should we pool SR costs across instruments when working out forecast p&L?

YAML:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
forecast_cost_estimate: use_pooled_costs: False ### use weighted average of
   SR cost * turnover across instruments with the same set of trading rules
   use_pooled_turnover: True ### Use weighted average of turnover across
   instruments with the same set of trading rules
#+END_EXAMPLE

**** Capital correction

Which capital correction method should we use?

YAML:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
capital_multiplier: func: syscore.capital.fixed_capital
#+END_EXAMPLE

Other valid functions include full_compounding and half_compounding.
